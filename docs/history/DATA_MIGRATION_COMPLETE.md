# Data Migration Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully moved all conversation data from the project's local `data/` directory to a centralized location accessible to the system.

## What Was Done

### 1. Data Migration ✅
- **Source**: `/mnt/dev/projects/llm-conversation-manager/data/`
- **Destination**: `/home/ashwin/data/llm-conversations/`
- **Files Moved**: All conversation data including:
  - `markdown-archive/` - 151 markdown conversation files
  - `to-process/` - Directory for files awaiting processing
  - `processed/` - Directory for successfully processed files
  - `failed/` - Directory for files that failed processing

### 2. Configuration Updates ✅
- Updated `.env` file to use new data path: `DATA_ROOT=/home/ashwin/data/llm-conversations`
- Updated `config/env.example` to reflect the new default path
- Verified the system can access all 151 markdown files in the new location

### 3. Verification ✅
- Confirmed all 151 markdown files are accessible in the new location
- Tested that the `DATA_ROOT` environment variable is properly loaded
- Verified file structure is intact with all subdirectories

## Data Structure
```
/home/ashwin/data/llm-conversations/
├── markdown-archive/     # 151 markdown conversation files
├── to-process/          # Files awaiting processing
├── processed/           # Successfully processed files
└── failed/             # Files that failed processing
```

## Next Steps
The consolidated `llm-conversation-manager` system is now ready to use with:
- All conversation data centralized in `/home/ashwin/data/llm-conversations/`
- Updated configuration pointing to the new data location
- All 151 markdown files accessible and ready for processing
- Old projects archived in `archived-llm-projects/` directory

The system can now be used to manage, search, and process all LLM conversations from a single unified interface.
