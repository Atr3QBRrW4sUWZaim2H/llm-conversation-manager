Below is a basic Python script that uses Home Assistant’s REST API to retrieve all entities and filter out those that belong to the `light` domain. Make sure you have a [Long-Lived Access Token](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/#long-lived-access-token) ready, and adjust the URL and token placeholders appropriately.

---

```python
import requests

# Replace the URL with the base address of your Home Assistant instance.
# For a standard installation, it's typically http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123
HA_URL = "http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states"

# Long-Lived Access Token from your Home Assistant user profile
TOKEN = "<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>"

def list_light_entities():
    """Fetch and print all entities in the 'light' domain."""
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(HA_URL, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        all_entities = response.json()
        light_entities = [
            entity["entity_id"] 
            for entity in all_entities 
            if entity["entity_id"].startswith("light.")
        ]

        if light_entities:
            print("List of Home Assistant light entities:")
            for entity_id in light_entities:
                print(f" - {entity_id}")
        else:
            print("No light entities found.")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"Error accessing Home Assistant API: {err}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    list_light_entities()
```

## Notes & Tips

1. **Network Access**: Ensure that the machine running this script has network access to the Home Assistant instance (e.g., same local network or via a VPN/remote route).

2. **Long-Lived Access Token**:
   - To create one, go to **Profile** in the Home Assistant UI and scroll down to the **Long-Lived Access Tokens** section.
   - Click **Create Token**, provide a name, and copy the token when prompted.
   - For security, do not share or commit your token to a public repository.

3. **HTTPS and Certificates**:
   - If your Home Assistant instance is secured via HTTPS (for example using Let’s Encrypt or another certificate provider), ensure that the URL starts with `https://` and that your Python environment trusts the certificate.
   - If you encounter SSL errors, you may need to add `verify=False` to the `requests.get(...)` call or supply a custom certificate bundle.

4. **Expanding Functionality**:
   - You can modify the script to display additional attributes (like the friendly name) by accessing fields within `entity["attributes"]`.
   - Similarly, if you’re building a Home Assistant management script, you can integrate HPC or other automation tasks that trigger events (e.g., controlling these lights dynamically, scheduling changes based on performance metrics, or combining them with other sensor data).

Feel free to customize the script or integrate it into larger automation, data science, or IoT pipelines. If you’re exploring HPC or advanced analytics down the road, you could store these entities in a database or feed them into a real-time event system to coordinate more complex tasks. Enjoy coding and automating!

Below is an updated example of how you could load the URL and token from a `.env` file. This approach uses the [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) package to load environment variables at runtime.

**Steps to use**:

1. Install the python-dotenv package (e.g., `pip install python-dotenv`).
2. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as this script. You can add the following lines there:
   ```plaintext
   HA_URL=http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states
   TOKEN=<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>
   ```
3. Run the Python script, ensuring that the `.env` is present and readable.

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve values from .env
# Example .env file:
# HA_URL=http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states
# TOKEN=<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>

HA_URL = os.getenv("HA_URL", "http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states")
TOKEN = os.getenv("TOKEN", "<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>")

def list_light_entities():
    """Fetch and print all entities in the 'light' domain."""
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(HA_URL, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        all_entities = response.json()
        light_entities = [
            entity["entity_id"]
            for entity in all_entities
            if entity["entity_id"].startswith("light.")
        ]

        if light_entities:
            print("List of Home Assistant light entities:")
            for entity_id in light_entities:
                print(f" - {entity_id}")
        else:
            print("No light entities found.")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"Error accessing Home Assistant API: {err}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    list_light_entities()
```

#### Further Enhancements

- **Custom `.env` File Path**: If your `.env` file resides outside the current directory, pass a parameter to `load_dotenv(dotenv_path=...)` specifying the file path.
- **Additional Variables**: You can add as many environment variables to `.env` as you like (e.g., `VERIFY_SSL`, `LOG_LEVEL`, etc.) and use them in your script.
- **Security & Source Control**: Typically, it’s best to exclude `.env` files from source control (e.g., using `.gitignore`) so that tokens and other secrets are not inadvertently published.

This error means Python cannot find the **python-dotenv** package in your (home-assistant) (myenv) virtual environment. To fix it, install `python-dotenv` **inside** the same virtual environment.

1. **Activate the virtual environment** (if not already activated):
   ```bash
   source /home/ashwin/home-assistant/myenv/bin/activate
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   source /home/ashwin/home-assistant/home-assistant/bin/activate
   ```
   (Adjust paths as needed based on how you set up your environment.)

2. **Install** `python-dotenv`:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Verify** the package is installed:
   ```bash
   pip show python-dotenv
   ```
   This should display version information, confirming a successful installation.

4. **Run** the script again:
   ```bash
   python3 list-lights.py
   ```
   It should now run without the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

#### Additional Tips

- If you have multiple Python environments, ensure you’re installing packages in the correct one. Using `python3 -m pip install python-dotenv` from within the active environment helps avoid confusion.
- Keep `.env` files (where your secrets live) out of version control for security reasons.
- If you continue seeing the same error, double-check that the (home-assistant) environment is active when running `python3 list-lights.py`.

Here’s an updated version of the script that also prints out each entity’s **friendly name** in addition to its ID. If a light entity does not have a `friendly_name` attribute set in Home Assistant, the script will show “Unknown.”

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve values from .env
# Example .env file:
# HA_URL=http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states
# TOKEN=<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>

HA_URL = os.getenv("HA_URL", "http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states")
TOKEN = os.getenv("TOKEN", "<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>")

def list_light_entities():
    """Fetch and print all entities in the 'light' domain, including their friendly names."""
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(HA_URL, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        all_entities = response.json()
        # Each entity is a dict with keys like "entity_id", "state", "attributes", etc.
        # We'll use "friendly_name" from "attributes" if available.
        light_entities = [
            {
                "entity_id": entity["entity_id"],
                "friendly_name": entity["attributes"].get("friendly_name", "Unknown")
            }
            for entity in all_entities
            if entity["entity_id"].startswith("light.")
        ]

        if light_entities:
            print("List of Home Assistant light entities:")
            for light in light_entities:
                print(f" - {light['entity_id']} (Name: {light['friendly_name']})")
        else:
            print("No light entities found.")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"Error accessing Home Assistant API: {err}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    list_light_entities()
```

### Explanation

- We used `entity["attributes"].get("friendly_name", "Unknown")` so that if `friendly_name` is missing, it will default to `"Unknown"`.
- The script will now provide more user-friendly output for each light entity in your Home Assistant setup.

Here’s an updated version of the script that attempts to flag “mismatches” between the **entity\_id** and the **friendly\_name**. The approach is fairly simple:

- Convert both the entity ID (minus the `light.` prefix) and the friendly name to lowercase and replace underscores (`_`) in the ID with spaces.
- If there’s no substring overlap, we assume there’s a mismatch.

Feel free to adjust the `is_mismatch` logic to suit your needs (e.g., by doing more sophisticated string matching or by focusing only on certain keywords).

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve values from .env
# Example .env file:
# HA_URL=http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states
# TOKEN=<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>

HA_URL = os.getenv("HA_URL", "http://<YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>:8123/api/states")
TOKEN = os.getenv("TOKEN", "<LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN>")

def is_mismatch(entity_id: str, friendly_name: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determine if the entity_id and friendly_name appear mismatched.
    
    A simple approach is to see if either name is a substring of the other
    (once underscores are converted to spaces and both are lowercased).
    If there's no overlap, we consider it a mismatch.
    """
    # Remove domain prefix
    if entity_id.startswith("light."):
        e_id = entity_id[len("light."):]  # e.g. "kitchen_overhead_lights"
    else:
        e_id = entity_id

    # Convert to lowercase and replace underscores with spaces
    e_id = e_id.lower().replace("_", " ")  # e.g. "kitchen overhead lights"
    f_name = friendly_name.lower()         # e.g. "kitchen overhead lights"

    # Check if there's any substring overlap
    if e_id in f_name or f_name in e_id:
        return False  # Not a mismatch
    return True       # Mismatch

def list_light_entities():
    """Fetch and print all 'light' entities with ID and Name, marking mismatches."""
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(HA_URL, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        all_entities = response.json()

        # Filter only light entities, gather ID and friendly_name
        light_entities = []
        for entity in all_entities:
            if entity["entity_id"].startswith("light."):
                light_entities.append({
                    "entity_id": entity["entity_id"],
                    "friendly_name": entity["attributes"].get("friendly_name", "Unknown")
                })

        if not light_entities:
            print("No light entities found.")
            return

        print("List of Home Assistant light entities:")
        for light in light_entities:

            friendly_name = light["friendly_name"]
            mismatch = is_mismatch(entity_id, friendly_name)

            if mismatch:
                print(f" - {entity_id} (Name: {friendly_name}) [MISMATCH]")

### Possible Enhancements

1. **Fuzzy Matching**: Instead of simple substring checks, you could use a library like [FuzzyWuzzy (RapidFuzz)](https://github.com/maxbachmann/rapidfuzz) to allow for partial matches or small typos in the names.
2. **Keyword-Based Logic**: If your naming conventions are fairly consistent (like always including “kitchen” or “overhead” for certain lights), you might build a dictionary of expected keywords to check for across entity IDs and friendly names.
3. **Logging or Reporting**: Instead of just printing, you might export the results to a CSV or log them to a file for more convenient auditing over time.

Fixing the mismatches involves **renaming either the entity IDs or the friendly names** so that they match more closely. This can be done directly in Home Assistant (HA), either through:

1. **The Home Assistant UI** (most common approach):
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities** in Home Assistant.
   - Find the entity you want to rename.
   - Click the entity, then **Edit**.
     - **Entity ID** can be changed in the **Entity ID** field.
     - **Friendly Name** can be changed in the **Name** field.
   - Save your changes.

2. **YAML configuration or customize.yaml** (if you’re using a YAML-based setup):
   - Look for the section in your configuration that defines the entity or a `customize:` block in `configuration.yaml` or `customize.yaml`.
   - Update the `friendly_name` or override the `entity_id` for that entity. For example:
     ```yaml
     homeassistant:
       customize:
         light.study_overhead_lights:
           friendly_name: Study Overhead Lights
     ```
   - Restart Home Assistant or reload YAML for changes to take effect.

---

## Tips for Consistent Naming

1. **Follow a Format**: Decide on a naming structure, such as `<Room>_<FixtureType>` for entity IDs (e.g., `light.kitchen_overhead`), and keep the friendly name close to that (e.g., **Kitchen Overhead**).
2. **Lowercase IDs & Underscores**: Home Assistant typically uses lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores in the entity IDs (e.g., `light.master_bedroom_lamp`).
3. **Readable Friendly Names**: For your **Name** (the “friendly\_name”), use human-friendly text with spaces and proper capitalization (e.g., **Master Bedroom Lamp**).

---

## Example Scenario

Suppose the script flags an entity:

```
 - light.office_floor_lamps (Name: Bedroom Floor Lamps) [MISMATCH]
```

If you want this entity to refer to your office lamps, you might do one of two things:

- **Change the Entity ID** to match the name:
  - **Entity ID**: `light.office_floor_lamps` → `light.bedroom_floor_lamps`
  - **Friendly Name**: remains **Bedroom Floor Lamps**\
    or

- **Change the Friendly Name** to match the ID:
  - **Entity ID**: remains `light.office_floor_lamps`
  - **Friendly Name**: **Office Floor Lamps**

Once the entity ID and friendly name align (e.g., `light.office_floor_lamps` / “Office Floor Lamps”), your script will no longer flag this as a mismatch.

By maintaining a **consistent naming convention** in both the entity IDs and friendly names, you can easily recognize each device in scripts, automations, and dashboards. After renaming in Home Assistant, re-run your Python script and confirm those mismatches have been resolved.

Below are some commonly recommended best practices and conventions when setting **entity IDs** and **friendly names** in Home Assistant:

---

### 1. Consistency in Naming Conventions

1. **Use Lowercase with Underscores** for entity IDs:
   - Example: `light.kitchen_overhead_lights`
   - Home Assistant typically enforces lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores in entity IDs. This makes referencing them in YAML and automations much easier.

2. **Use Descriptive, Human-Friendly Text** for friendly names:
   - Example: **Kitchen Overhead Lights**
   - Friendly names (often labeled simply as “Name” in the UI) are shown in the Lovelace dashboard and other front-end interfaces, so clarity helps.

3. **Keep it Short, but Specific**:
   - Overly long names can become cumbersome in the UI and are awkward to reference in automations. However, too generic can be confusing if you have multiple devices in a single room (e.g., “Kitchen Light 1” vs. “Kitchen Overhead Lights”).

---

### 2. Unique Identifiers

1. **Keep Each Entity ID Unique**:
   - Home Assistant enforces uniqueness, but it’s good to watch out if you rename multiple entities to the same ID by accident.
2. **Friendly Names Can Duplicate**:
   - If you happen to have two different bulbs both called **Living Room Lamp**, it can cause user confusion in the UI, but it won’t break Home Assistant.
   - It’s still better to keep them distinct when possible (e.g., “Living Room Lamp Left” and “Living Room Lamp Right”).

---

### 3. Structure for Easy Organization

1. **Room-Based Prefixing**:
   - Put the room or zone first, then the device type:
     - `light.living_room_table_lamp`
     - `light.bedroom_floor_lamp`
   - This pattern makes it easy to filter or search for all devices in a given room.

2. **Decorator or Fixture Type**:
   - Indicate the fixture type: overhead lights, sconce, lamp, strip, etc.
   - E.g. `light.bathroom_sconce_1`, `light.bathroom_sconce_2`, `light.kitchen_pendant_lamp`.

3. **Consistent Words**:
   - Use the same descriptive keywords so you can quickly find all items of that type:
     - Use “overhead\_lights” consistently across multiple rooms (e.g., `bedroom_overhead_lights`, `kitchen_overhead_lights`).

### 4. Editing Entity ID vs. Friendly Name

1. **Entity ID** changes can affect any automations or scripts that reference that ID, so always double-check your references.
2. **Friendly Name** changes do not break references but will change how the device appears in the UI.

If you do rename entity IDs:

- Use the Home Assistant UI:\
  **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities** → Select entity → **Edit** → Change **Entity ID**.
- If using YAML-based configuration, update it in your `.yaml` or `customize.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  homeassistant:
    customize:
      light.old_entity_id:
        friendly_name: New Friendly Name
        # or for the entity_id rename, you might define it in your integrations' YAML config
  ```
- **Restart** Home Assistant or reload YAML for changes to take effect if you’re using YAML.

---

### 5. Automation and Voice Control Considerations

1. **Make the Friendly Name Voice-Friendly**:
   - If you use voice assistants (Google Assistant, Alexa, etc.), pick a name that is easy to say and less prone to misinterpretation.
   - For example, “Kitchen Overhead” is more concise than “Kitchen Overhead Lights with the Fancy Fixture,” which can lead to confusion.

2. **Use the Same Terms for Automations**:
   - If you have an automation that references `light.study_overhead_lights`, keep that ID/Name synergy so your automation is self-descriptive in code.

---

### 6. Document Your Conventions

1. **Write Down a Naming Standard**:
   - If you have many devices, keep a short guide for yourself and anyone else configuring devices (e.g., “Entity IDs always use `<area>_<fixture>` format; friendly names are `<Area> <Fixture>` capitalized.”).
2. **Use Integrations**:
   - Some integrations auto-generate entity IDs and friendly names. Renaming them to match your custom structure keeps your setup clean and consistent.

---

## Conclusion

- **Consistent** use of underscores for entity IDs and **readable** friendly names leads to a clear, maintainable configuration.
- Always double-check references in automations or scripts when renaming entity IDs.
- Taking the time to unify naming across your Home Assistant environment makes it easier to manage now and more scalable in the future.
