House
Garage Door
Fully close the garage door before opening the door to the house to prevent the dogs from escaping
Similarly, fully close and lock the door from the house before opening the garage door
The garage code is 2556
Use this code on the white garage keypad located on the garage door closest to the gate (lift open the front panel)
Enter the code and then press Enter (the up/down button)
If the door does not close fully, remove anything blocking the garage door from closing
Both garage doors have a backup battery, so the doors should still work during a power outage
The garage doors will not close automatically. Make sure to close the garage doors before leaving the house and after returning.
Mail & Packages
The mailbox the green one located at the end of Pearl, where it intersects with Diamond; it is marked with “7301”
Check the mailbox periodically; USPS sometimes delivers packages to the mailbox which fills it up quickly
Larger packages and packages from other carriers are delivered to the delivery box in the driveway
Trash & Trash Pickup
The trash cans are located in the driveway
Trash: Black Bin
Recycling: Blue Bins
Take out the trash on Sunday night; trash pickups are early Monday morning
Recycling is picked up on alternating weeks

schedule


Utility Shutoffs
The circuit breaker for the entire house is in the mudroom
The garage has a subpanel on the back wall that can be turned off independently of the main breaker
The water shutoff valve is located in the basement, in the media room; on the right as soon as you enter
The primary propane shutoff valve is located on the propane tank, which is next to the driveway, next to the entry gate.
The secondary propane shutoff valve is located just outside the mudroom door, next to the water spigot.
Thermostats
The thermostat in the living room controls the first floor temperature
The thermostat in the basement common area controls the basement temperature
Thermostats within a room control the temperature only within that room
The house has a hydronic heating system that maintains the temperature automatically
This system is not meant to heat areas quickly; if possible avoid adjusting temperatures too often
Dogs
Please call the vet first in case of any emergency
Bruce
Updated Feb 21, 2025
Food
Feed 1 pack of Farmer’s Dog over the course of 1 day
Bruce’s food is labeled with his name
Feed 3 times / day; for example:
9am
12pm
5pm
Bruce is recovering from surgery for an intestinal blockage, so his intestine and abdomen are still healing.
He is at small risk of the incisions reopening, so he needs to be rested.
Give Bruce 100mg of Trazedone if he is too active, like running around the yard or running up and down the stairs.
Bruce also should not climb onto furniture. 
Bruce can sleep in the utility room or the basement with the door closed so he cannot run up and down the stairs.
Monitor Bruce for any signs of:
Reduced water intake
Reduced appetite
Reduced energy or alertness (eg: less anxiety; more laying down; no tail wagging; ears not pointed up)
Vomiting, diarrhea, etc. 
And other signs of a distressed dog
If Bruce is exhibiting any of these signs, Call Animal Emergency & Specialty Center in Poulsbo 360 - 697 - 7771. They have Bruce’s records and can advise on what to do next.
Boba
Feed 1 pack of Farmer’s Dog over the course of 1 day
Boba’s food is labeled with his name
Feed 2 times / day; for example:
12pm
5pm
Boba does best with at least 30 minutes of exercise per day; for example:
Walk around the neighborhood
Throwing the ball around in the yard (find the ChuckIt thrower)
Boba sleeps in the utility / laundry room. He knows the command “go home”. When you say that he will go to the utility room. Follow Boba to the room and give him a treat. He can be in that room for up to 12 hours at a time.
Cleaning
Dishwasher
The dish washing detergent is located under the kitchen sink (Cascades Pods)
Load the pod into the dishwasher soap dispenser and close the door; make sure the door clicks shut
Load the dishwasher and use the “Auto” setting
Press “Start”; the display on the dishwasher should show “2:55” without blinking
Close the dishwasher door; this will start the dishwasher
You should see a solid red light projected onto the floor on the right ride of the dishwasher
If you see a flashing red light or the display does not read “2:55” without blinking, reset the settings by holding down the “Start” button until the display reads “00”, then turning off the dishwasher and turning it on again using the power button (leftmost button)
Here is dishwasher’s  Quick Start Guide, and here is the full Owner’s Manual
Clothes Washing and Drying
There are 2 sets of washing and drying machines
Master Bedroom


Utility / Laundry Room


Lights
All lights in the house can controlled by either a hardware switch or by app
The exterior lights are automatic; they do not need to be turned on or off manually unless desired
Dogs Continued
If Lost / Escaped
Immediately: Call the dog’s name loudly and shake or crinkle a treat bag; walk/run in the direction of the dog
If a dog escapes at home, usually the dogs go to the neighbor’s house first.
Text Mette (neighbor) and let her know that the dog escaped and to keep an eye out
After the neighbor’s house, usually the dogs continue up the hill to the end of Diamond Pl. Start walking on the street up the hill, shaking the treat bag and calling the dog’s name
Less often, the dogs will go towards the main road (Lynwood Center Rd)
Have someone drive on this road, taking a left out of the neighborhood (go north)
Drive slowly with lights on to warn people that there may be a dog in the area
Park somewhere close and call the dog’s name with some treats.
Try to slow oncoming cars
After 5 minutes: Both dogs have an Airtag on their collar
Ideally this would have been paired with your phone before leaving
Open the Apple “Find My” app and go to the “Items” tab
Once the dogs are within range of any other iPhone, their location will update on this map
Activate “lost mode” on the lost dog’s air tag and add a note; this will show on people’s iPhones when the dog is in range
After 10 Minutes: Call Ashwin and Emma immediately
After 1 hour: File a lost dog report here 
After 3 hours: Call the Kitsap Humane Society and report the dog lost: (360) 692-6977
After 5 hours: Put out food and the dog bed on the porch
Dog Containment
Exiting the House
Always make sure that both garage doors and the garage side door are closed at all times
This forms a dog “air lock” that reduces the risk of the dogs escaping
Always enter and exit the house via the garage
Before opening the garage side door, check to see that both garage doors are closed.
If not, corral the dogs inside the house and then open the side door to close the garage door.
When exiting the house, ensure that the dogs do not follow you into the garage; this may take 2 people
Pay special attention to Bruce; he is very motivated to leave the house
After exiting the house, ensure that both garage doors are fully closed before leaving the driveway
Use the garage keypad to close the right garage door (Code: 2556)
If no one will be home when you leave, ensure that the dogs are outside (see next section)
Entering the House
Always make sure that both garage doors and the garage side door are closed at all times
This forms a dog “air lock” that reduces the risk of the dogs escaping
Always enter and exit the house via the garage
Always make sure that both garage doors are fully closed before opening the side door to the house; never exit the garage to the house if one of the garage doors is still open
Containment Areas
The dogs can be contained in several areas by closing various gates and doors. This is useful for getting them out of the house or to separate them for feeding
Closing the front door and mud room gate splits the house in to “inside” and “outside”
Inside: the dogs can go anywhere in the house
Outside: the dogs can go anywhere outside and into the mudroom
Put the dogs outside when there is no one home
Use the deck gate to control access to the deck (eg: inside the house and the deck)
Use the basement door to control access to the basement
Use the basement gate to control access to the basement bedrooms (usually this should be closed)
If a stranger is coming to the house, put the dogs in the utility room in the basement while that person is here
The utility room is the large room in the basement at the end of the hallway on the right (not the bedroom). This is the room with the utility sink and chest freezer.
Make sure that the dogs have water and possibly some toys while in the utility room

Here are a few recommended updates and additions based on your current draft. Feel free to pick and choose whichever ones make sense for your situation:

---

### 1. Fill in missing info for The Great Outdoors Pup Camp

You have a placeholder for the contact info:

>  $contact info?$

> If you plan to use this boarding or daycare service, be sure to include:

- Phone number
- Website or email
- Any special instructions or forms required in case of emergency drop-off

---

### 2. Clarify Bruce’s Post-Surgery Restrictions

Since Bruce is healing from abdominal surgery, it might help to add a bit more detail on his activity limits:

- **Stairs:** Note that Bruce should avoid stairs when possible. If absolutely necessary, he should be on-leash or guided slowly.
- **Furniture/Jumping:** Reinforce that he should not jump onto furniture or high surfaces. You’ve already mentioned this, but sometimes clarifying “no jumping, no rough play” is helpful.
- **Leash Guidance:** If there is a yard or deck where Bruce can roam freely, mention whether he should be on-leash for bathroom breaks or short walks to limit sprinting.
- **Medication Timing:** If Trazodone is only given as needed, clarify frequency (e.g., “only once every 8 hours,” if that’s what your vet advised).

---

### 3. Boba’s Exercise vs. Bruce’s Restrictions

Because Boba needs daily exercise and Bruce is restricted, you might include:

- **Separate Walks:** If both dogs typically walk together, suggest separate walks for now, so Bruce doesn’t get overexcited trying to keep up.
- **Indoor Activities for Boba:** If weather or time doesn’t permit an outdoor walk, mention alternative ways to keep Boba mentally stimulated (e.g., puzzle feeders, interactive toys).

---

### 4. Medication Administration Notes

If Bruce is taking Trazodone (100 mg) “as needed”:

- Include a quick note on **how** to give it (e.g., hide in a treat, pill pocket, or with food).
- Note any side effects to watch for, like drowsiness or stumbling.

---

### 5. Feeding & Storage Details

- If Farmer’s Dog food requires refrigeration or freezing, specify **“Keep unopened packs frozen, thaw before feeding,”** or your preferred approach.
- Indicate **where** to find the dog food in the refrigerator or freezer and how to handle leftovers.

---

### 6. Wi-Fi and Internet Access

If you often have house-sitters or guests:

- Consider adding Wi-Fi **network name** and **password** in the manual, or at least where to locate that information in the house.

---

### 7. Emergency Preparedness

You already note how to shut off water, propane, and use the breaker panels. You might also include:

- Location of **fire extinguishers** (e.g., kitchen, near furnace, in the garage).
- Any instructions for **generators** or **backup power** (if you have them).
- If the property is prone to winter storms or power outages, mention **how to handle extended outages** (e.g., keep faucets dripping in freezing temps, or use battery lanterns).

---

### 8. Quick Reference / Table of Contents

Because the manual is long, you might include a **one-page summary** or table of contents:

- **One-Page Quick Start** with essential info:
  - Contact phone numbers
  - Garage code
  - Dog feeding times
  - Trash pickup day
- **Detailed Sections** can follow after that page.

---

### 9. Clarify Any “Smart Home” Features

You mention lights can be controlled by either hardware switches or an app. If there’s an app you want sitters to use:

- **Name of the app** (e.g., Philips Hue, Lutron, etc.)
- **Login info** or whether they’ll need an account
- **Which lights are most important to manage manually**

---

### 10. Lockout / Spare Key Procedure

If someone accidentally locks themselves out:

- Where is the spare key located, or is there another pin code for the front door?
- Who to call if the code/lock malfunctions?

---

### 11. Consider Compost or Other Local Disposal

You have trash and recycling details; if your area also has **compost/yard waste**, note:

- Which day(s) it’s picked up
- Where to find compost bags or bins

---

### 12. Confirm Neighbors’ Contact (if relevant)

You mention texting Mette (the neighbor) if the dogs escape.

- Include Mette’s phone number if comfortable (or confirm it’s in the sitter’s phone).
- Note if they have a dog that might come by or if the sitter can reach out for dog playdates.

---

### 13. Formatting and Quick Links

Where you mention the **dishwasher manuals**:

> Here is dishwasher’s Quick Start Guide, and here is the full Owner’s Manual

- If this is a printed guide, consider linking or embedding a **QR code** that leads to the PDF/manual online.
- If you share the manual digitally (e.g., Google Drive), ensure the permissions are set so sitters can view it.

---

## Putting It All Together

Overall, your House Manual is already very thorough. By adding some of these clarifications—especially around Bruce’s recovery protocol, Boba’s exercise routine, contact info for The Great Outdoors Pup Camp, and any Wi-Fi or spare key details—you’ll make it even easier for a house-sitter (or anyone else) to confidently take care of your home and pets.
