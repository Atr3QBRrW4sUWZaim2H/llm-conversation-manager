# Environmental Pressures of AI Beyond Electricity Consumption

## Water Usage in AI Data Centers  
AI data centers consume **enormous volumes of water** for cooling, often straining local water resources. A single **1 MW data center can use up to 26 million liters of water per year**, about as much as 62 U.S. households combined ([
	AI Data Centers Threaten Global Water Security | Lawfare
](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ai-data-centers-threaten-global-water-security#:~:text=While%20data%20centers%E2%80%99%20energy%20consumption,of%20over%202%20million%20families)). With the rapid growth of AI, many new server farms are being built in **water-stressed regions** that can ill afford this usage. In the United States, roughly **32% of data centers are located in areas of high or extremely high baseline water stress** ([AI needs to reduce its water dependency - Planet Tracker](https://planet-tracker.org/ai-needs-to-reduce-its-water-dependency/#:~:text=water%20stress%20data,are%20within%20areas%20of%20high)). For example, **California’s tech hubs** rely on dozens of data centers in drought-prone areas (Los Angeles has 68, San Jose 32), and **Arizona hosts 86 centers** despite chronic water scarcity ([AI needs to reduce its water dependency - Planet Tracker](https://planet-tracker.org/ai-needs-to-reduce-its-water-dependency/#:~:text=water%20stress%20data,are%20within%20areas%20of%20high)). This concentration has tangible local impacts: in **Loudoun County, Virginia** – home to “Data Center Alley” – data center freshwater consumption surged **250% since 2019**, contributing to **drought-like conditions for residents** ([
	AI Data Centers Threaten Global Water Security | Lawfare
](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ai-data-centers-threaten-global-water-security#:~:text=concern%20in%20advanced%20economies%20as,Meta%E2%80%99s)). In Europe, similar tensions arose when **Meta’s planned data center in Zeewolde, Netherlands** faced *massive local opposition* over its potential drawdown of groundwater; Dutch authorities ultimately **revoked the zoning permission** for the project ([
	AI Data Centers Threaten Global Water Security | Lawfare

China is also experiencing a steep rise in data center water demand. A recent analysis estimates China’s data centers currently consume **~1.3 billion m³ of water per year and could exceed 3 billion m³ by 2030** as AI computing expands ([China data center water demand to double by 2030 – report - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/china-data-center-water-demand-to-double-by-2030-report/#:~:text=CWR%20estimates%20China%E2%80%99s%20data%20center,than%203bn%20m3%20by%202030)). Worryingly, **only 32% of China’s data center racks are in water-rich regions**, while nearly half sit in the nation’s driest areas (as arid as the Middle East) ([China data center water demand to double by 2030 – report - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/china-data-center-water-demand-to-double-by-2030-report/#:~:text=Only%2032%20percent%20of%20China%27s,are%20very%20prone%20to%20both)). This **“thirst” for water** has led experts to warn that AI-driven data center growth may soon **rival or surpass traditionally water-intensive industries like cattle ranching and textiles** ([

Without significant transparency and planning, the cooling needs of AI could exacerbate **water scarcity**, spark community backlash, and **heighten ecological and political risks** in affected regions ([

## Rare Mineral Extraction and Waste for AI Hardware  
Behind advanced AI hardware lies a **supply chain of rare minerals** whose extraction brings its own environmental toll. **Cobalt, lithium, gallium, germanium**, and various rare earth elements are critical for components like high-performance chips, circuit boards, and backup batteries. **Mining and refining these minerals is resource-intensive and often highly polluting.** For example, lithium – essential for energy storage and some data center batteries – is typically harvested by evaporating brine from salt flats, a **water-intensive process requiring around *500,000 gallons of water per ton of lithium*** ([South America’s Lithium Triangle: Opportunities for the Biden Administration](https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-americas-lithium-triangle-opportunities-biden-administration#:~:text=up%20to%2018%20months.%20Mineral,the%20water%20shortages%20and%20potential)). In Chile’s **Atacama Desert**, one of the world’s lithium hubs, this has contributed to a **local water sustainability crisis**, depleting aquifers and even causing fresh water to become **salinized as brine extraction draws in groundwater** ([South America’s Lithium Triangle: Opportunities for the Biden Administration](https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-americas-lithium-triangle-opportunities-biden-administration#:~:text=from%20other%20minerals.%20The%20water,South%20America%3B%20some%20of%20them)) ([How Critical Minerals Mining Affects Water | World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/insights/critical-minerals-mining-water-impacts#:~:text=This%20evaporation%20method%20uses%20up,nearby%20surface%20and%20groundwater%20supplies)). The impact ripples to indigenous communities and farmers, who see **wetlands and crops desiccated** by the diversion of water for “white gold” lithium ([South America’s Lithium Triangle: Opportunities for the Biden Administration](https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-americas-lithium-triangle-opportunities-biden-administration#:~:text=of%20lithium%20extracted,industry%20must%20find%20a%20way)).  

Other minerals crucial to AI are obtained at steep environmental and human cost. **Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)** – source of ~70% of the world’s cobalt – has led to **toxic waste dumping that devastates landscapes, pollutes rivers, and contaminates crops** ([The Environmental Impacts of Cobalt Mining in Congo | Earth.Org](https://earth.org/cobalt-mining-in-congo/#:~:text=The%C2%A0Environmental%20Impacts%20of%20Cobalt%20Mining,in%20Congo)). Local communities near large industrial cobalt mines in the DRC face **severe water pollution**, to the point that many **lack clean drinking water** and suffer health problems from metal contamination ([New report exposes the environmental and human costs of DRC’s cobalt boom - RAID](https://raid-uk.org/report-environmental-pollution-human-costs-drc-cobalt-demand-industrial-mines-green-energy-evs-2024/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20released%20today,cobalt%20belt%20of%20southern%20DRC)) ([New report exposes the environmental and human costs of DRC’s cobalt boom - RAID](https://raid-uk.org/report-environmental-pollution-human-costs-drc-cobalt-demand-industrial-mines-green-energy-evs-2024/#:~:text=Communities%20visited%20by%20RAID%20and,More%20and%20more)). In one investigation, 56% of residents interviewed around DRC mining areas reported mining-related pollution affecting women’s reproductive health (e.g. higher miscarriage rates), underscoring the **human toll of unchecked mineral extraction** ([New report exposes the environmental and human costs of DRC’s cobalt boom - RAID](https://raid-uk.org/report-environmental-pollution-human-costs-drc-cobalt-demand-industrial-mines-green-energy-evs-2024/#:~:text=Communities%20visited%20by%20RAID%20and,More%20and%20more)). Even “cleaner” aspects of the tech supply chain hide dirty secrets: **rare earth element processing** (needed for components like **gallium** and **germanium** semiconductors and other electronics) produces **large volumes of toxic waste**. The chemical difficulty of separating these elements means refinement generates **hazardous byproducts**, and historically **lax environmental standards** – for instance in China’s rare earth industry – enabled dominance in production at the cost of **significant pollution** ([China's rare earths dominance in focus after it limits germanium and gallium exports | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-rare-earths-dominance-focus-after-mineral-export-curbs-2023-07-05/#:~:text=as%20uranium%20and%20thorium)). In fact, China’s past rare earth export restrictions were officially justified on environmental grounds, acknowledging the heavy **soil and water contamination** from mining and refining these materials ([China's rare earths dominance in focus after it limits germanium and gallium exports | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-rare-earths-dominance-focus-after-mineral-export-curbs-2023-07-05/#:~:text=The%20chemical%20properties%20of%20rare,processing%20can%20generate%20toxic%20waste)).  

Finally, the **electronic waste (e-waste)** associated with AI hardware is an emerging concern. AI systems depend on constant hardware upgrades – from **GPUs** to specialized AI accelerators – which can lead to relatively short device lifespans. If not recycled, these devices add to the **mounting e-waste stream** already seen in the tech sector. (For comparison, the Bitcoin network’s specialized hardware turnover currently generates an estimated **30,700 metric tons of electronic waste per year** ([
            Bitcoin’s E-Waste Problem is Hiding in Plain Sight - Greenpeace - Greenpeace
    ](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/bitcoins-e-waste-problem-is-hiding-in-plain-sight/#:~:text=E,waste%20per%20year)).) Discarded servers, circuit boards and batteries from AI data centers contain not only precious metals (gold, copper, rare earths) but also **toxic substances** (lead, arsenic, mercury) that can leach into ecosystems if landfilled. The mining required to replace these devices only compounds the **cycle of extraction and waste**. In short, the **material backbone of AI – the mining of rare minerals and the disposal of high-tech hardware – carries significant environmental pressures**, from **deforestation and water depletion** at mine sites to **toxic pollution and e-waste** that challenge global waste management. These impacts are often **out of sight** of end-users, happening in distant mines or factories, but they are very much part of AI’s environmental footprint.

## Land Use Conflicts from AI Infrastructure Expansion  
The physical expansion of AI infrastructure – especially large data centers – is increasingly leading to **land use conflicts and ecological impacts**. Unlike invisible cloud services, data centers occupy **vast tracts of land** for buildings, cooling infrastructure, and power equipment. In major tech hubs, this has been described as *“suburban sprawl on steroids, with attendant deforestation, loss of farmland and loss of wildlife habitat.”* ([Causes and Effects of Widespread Data Center Development | Planetizen News](https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/12/120435-causes-and-effects-widespread-data-center-development#:~:text=steroids%2C%20with%20its%20attendant%20deforestation%2C,and%20drinking%20water%20resources%20miles)) Entire fields and woodlands have been cleared to make way for server farms. A single facility can cover dozens of acres, and campuses often cluster in technology corridors, multiplying the **habitat loss**. For instance, Northern Virginia’s data center boom has transformed rural landscapes – forests and farms give way to boxy warehouses, undermining local efforts to preserve green space. **Deforestation** not only destroys habitat directly but can fragment surrounding ecosystems, pushing out species that once thrived in those areas. In addition, paving over large areas creates **impervious surfaces** that disrupt natural water drainage: massive rooftops and parking lots cause stormwater to run off rapidly, contributing to **flooding and stream erosion** in nearby communities ([Causes and Effects of Widespread Data Center Development | Planetizen News](https://www.planetizen.com/news/2022/12/120435-causes-and-effects-widespread-data-center-development#:~:text=steroids%2C%20with%20its%20attendant%20deforestation%2C,and%20drinking%20water%20resources%20miles)). Local water supplies can be impacted as well, since natural groundwater recharge is reduced by all the concrete. 

Beyond environmental degradation, **data center land grabs can spark community opposition** when they threaten cultural or livelihood values. In some cases, **local communities are displaced or pressured** as land values soar and zoning changes to favor data center development. Even when outright displacement is rare, residents often raise concerns about **noise from generators and cooling towers**, **increased traffic**, and the loss of community character. A notable conflict unfolded in **Prince William County, Virginia**, where a plan to rezone ~2,100 acres of rural land for the *“Prince William Digital Gateway”* (billed as the world’s largest data center campus) met fierce resistance. Conservation and historic preservation groups warned of “**irreversible desecration of hallowed ground**,” noting the site borders **Manassas National Battlefield Park** and contains wetlands and historic rural landscapes ([Leading Conservation Organizations File Amicus Brief In Opposition to World's Largest Data Center Development | American Battlefield Trust](https://www.battlefields.org/news/leading-conservation-organizations-file-amicus-brief-opposition-worlds-largest-data-center#:~:text=stop%20construction%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,%E2%80%9D)). Despite these concerns, local officials initially green-lit the project, illustrating how **regulatory processes can favor tech development over local environmental priorities**. Only after lawsuits and an election did prospects dim for that development, highlighting a governance struggle over land use. Similarly, in the **Netherlands**, public outcry over a proposed giant data center on prime farmland (with implications for local aquifers and agriculture) forced a reevaluation of data center siting policy ([
	AI Data Centers Threaten Global Water Security | Lawfare
](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ai-data-centers-threaten-global-water-security#:~:text=plans%20to%20build%20data%20centers,potential%20impact%20on%20groundwater%20reserves)).  These examples show that AI infrastructure expansion can lead to **deforestation, wetland draining, and conversion of agricultural land**, while also creating flashpoints between **corporate interests and community/environmental stakeholders**. The challenge lies in balancing the need for digital infrastructure with the equally critical need to preserve ecosystems and respect local land rights.

## Carbon Footprint of AI Chip Manufacturing (Scope 3 Emissions)  
The **carbon footprint of AI extends well beyond the electricity used to run algorithms**, reaching deep into the manufacturing of the hardware itself. Producing advanced semiconductor chips – the “brains” of AI systems – is an **energy-intensive and emissions-heavy process**. In fact, **making a computer chip can consume more energy than the chip will use over its entire 10-year lifetime** ([Cutting the carbon footprint of future computer chips - The Salata Institute](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/cutting-the-carbon-footprint-of-future-computer-chips/#:~:text=make%20these%20transistors%20ever%20smaller)). This startling fact reflects the extreme conditions and complex supply chains involved in chip fabrication. Modern chip factories (“fabs”) operate ultra-clean rooms with **1,000°C furnaces**, plasma etching, and **extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography** machines that consume huge amounts of electricity ([Cutting the carbon footprint of future computer chips - The Salata Institute](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/cutting-the-carbon-footprint-of-future-computer-chips/#:~:text=A%20chip%E2%80%99s%20carbon%20footprint%20spans,of%20modern%20computing%E2%80%99s%20carbon%20footprint)). These processes also use **potent greenhouse gases** (like perfluorocarbons for etching) and chemicals that require energy to produce, all contributing to the **upstream carbon footprint** of each chip. 

Studies have attempted to quantify this embodied carbon. One industry analysis finds that **about 75% of a semiconductor device’s total CO₂ emissions come from manufacturing and upstream supply chain (Scope 3) activities** ([Sustainable Semiconductor Manufacturing to Meet Climate Goals](https://sourceability.com/post/sustainable-semiconductor-manufacturing-to-meet-climate-goals#:~:text=The%20semiconductor%20industry%20greatly%20contributes,semiconductors%27%20rapidly%20growing%20carbon%20footprint)). Only the remaining 25% or so is due to the device’s electricity use over its life. Boston Consulting Group estimates that **semiconductor devices made in 2021 will ultimately be responsible for ~500 million metric tons of CO₂** over their lifetimes – roughly the carbon output of a country like Turkey – with **35% of those emissions coming from materials and production (fabrication of the chips and wafers)** ([A Plan to Reduce Semiconductor Emissions | BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/a-plan-to-reduce-semiconductor-emissions#:~:text=footprint%20of%20nearly%20500%20megatonnes,use%20of%20devices%20by%20consumers)). The most **advanced AI chips have especially large footprints** because their fabrication is more complex (requiring more processing steps and exotic materials) ([Cutting the carbon footprint of future computer chips - The Salata Institute](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/cutting-the-carbon-footprint-of-future-computer-chips/#:~:text=A%20chip%E2%80%99s%20carbon%20footprint%20spans,of%20modern%20computing%E2%80%99s%20carbon%20footprint)). Paradoxically, as chips become more energy-efficient in operation, they often *cost more energy to manufacture per unit*. As Harvard researcher Gage Hills notes, **“the energy it takes to physically manufacture a computer chip can be more than the chip consumes in its entire lifetime.”** ([Cutting the carbon footprint of future computer chips - The Salata Institute](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/cutting-the-carbon-footprint-of-future-computer-chips/#:~:text=make%20these%20transistors%20ever%20smaller))  

An often overlooked aspect is the **supply chain emissions** associated with chipmaking. This includes **mining and refining of raw materials** (silicon, copper, rare-earth metals, etc.), production of silicon wafers, chemicals, and the construction and maintenance of fabrication facilities. For example, producing the **specialty gases and photochemicals** for lithography, or the **single-crystal silicon wafers**, all generate CO₂ upstream. These emissions (Scope 3 for data center operators and AI companies) are usually **invisible on corporate balance sheets**, since they occur at supplier sites in places like Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, or the US. Yet they are significant: **Scope 3 upstream emissions make up roughly 40% of total emissions in the chip industry** according to some estimates ([Decarbonization Challenges for Chip and Silicon Wafer Manufacturers](https://www.waferworld.com/post/decarbonization-challenges-for-chip-and-silicon-wafer-manufacturers#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20are%20the,of%20chip%20makers%27%20carbon)). This means that a company deploying AI hardware could be indirectly responsible for a large carbon load embedded in that equipment’s creation. In sum, the carbon impact of AI is **not just a function of data center electricity (Scope 2)**; it is deeply tied to **Scope 3 emissions from manufacturing**. From the **coal-fired power that may run an Asian chip factory** to the **transportation emissions** of shipping servers worldwide, these hidden carbon costs pose a challenge for sustainable AI. Any comprehensive look at AI’s climate impact must account for this **embodied carbon in AI hardware** – currently a **significant and growing source of CO₂ emissions** ([Sustainable Semiconductor Manufacturing to Meet Climate Goals](https://sourceability.com/post/sustainable-semiconductor-manufacturing-to-meet-climate-goals#:~:text=The%20semiconductor%20industry%20greatly%20contributes,semiconductors%27%20rapidly%20growing%20carbon%20footprint)) ([A Plan to Reduce Semiconductor Emissions | BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/a-plan-to-reduce-semiconductor-emissions#:~:text=footprint%20of%20nearly%20500%20megatonnes,use%20of%20devices%20by%20consumers)).

## Comparing AI’s Environmental Impact to Cryptocurrency Mining and Traditional Data Centers  
It’s instructive to compare AI’s environmental footprint with those of **cryptocurrency mining** and **traditional (non-AI) data centers**, two sectors that have garnered attention for their resource usage. In many ways, **AI data centers and crypto mining operations share similar challenges**: both are extremely **power-hungry** and generate substantial heat, driving high cooling demands. In 2022, the combined electricity consumption of global data centers (including AI facilities) and crypto miners was estimated at **about 2% of world electricity use** ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=Crypto%20mining%20and%20data%20centers,and%20their%20footprint%20is%20growing)). This share is rapidly rising – projected to reach **3.5% of global electricity by 2025** (comparable to the power usage of Japan) as AI adoption and crypto activities grow ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=As%20the%20Chart%20of%20the,world%E2%80%99s%20fifth%20largest%20electricity%20user)). **Carbon emissions** from these digital industries are likewise surging. The IMF projects that by 2027, **crypto mining could contribute about 0.7% of global CO₂ emissions**, and data centers (largely driven by AI and cloud growth) about **450 million tons CO₂ annually (~1.2% of global emissions)** ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=The%20climate%20impact%20of%20these,percent%20of%20the%20world%20total)). In other words, the climate impact of running AI systems may soon rival that of some older heavy industries. Notably, AI’s carbon footprint stems from both **energy use and hardware manufacturing**, whereas Bitcoin’s footprint is almost entirely from energy. 

Where AI and crypto differ is in **intensity and waste**. Cryptocurrency (especially Bitcoin) mining is notoriously energy-intensive by design – **each Bitcoin transaction uses roughly as much electricity as an average person in Ghana or Pakistan uses in *three years*** ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=Because%20of%20the%20electricity%20used,consumed%20by%20AI%20data%20centers)). This is due to the Proof-of-Work algorithms that require massive computations. AI tasks vary, but already a single **ChatGPT query is estimated to consume **10×** the electricity of a typical Google web search** ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=Because%20of%20the%20electricity%20used,consumed%20by%20AI%20data%20centers)), reflecting the huge computational load of large language models. Thus, on a per-operation basis, **AI can be orders of magnitude more resource-intensive than conventional internet services**. Additionally, crypto mining’s rapid hardware turnover produces **astonishing e-waste**: specialized ASIC miners become obsolete quickly and get discarded. As of 2021, the Bitcoin network was generating **30,700 metric tons of electronic waste per year** from trashed mining rigs ([
            Bitcoin’s E-Waste Problem is Hiding in Plain Sight - Greenpeace - Greenpeace
    ](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/bitcoins-e-waste-problem-is-hiding-in-plain-sight/#:~:text=E,waste%20per%20year)). Traditional data centers refresh hardware on a longer cycle (servers might last 3-5 years), so their e-waste, while significant, is spread out. AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) currently see upgrade cycles to keep up with model demands, potentially shortening replacement times and adding **more e-waste of high-end electronics** if not recycled. In terms of **water usage**, most Bitcoin mines are air-cooled and located where power is cheap (China’s Sichuan, upstate New York, Texas, etc.), sometimes even tapping **dormant fossil plants or hydro dams**. They typically haven’t faced the same water scrutiny as cloud data centers. AI data centers, on the other hand, often use water-intensive cooling in hot climates or at massive scale, thus their **water footprint can exceed that of crypto operations** (which is small beyond electricity generation’s indirect water use).  

Traditional enterprise data centers (for banking, web hosting, etc.) have become more efficient over the last decade, **flattening their energy demand** even as compute workloads grew, thanks to virtualization and better cooling tech. However, the **AI boom is reversing this trend**: unlike conventional workloads that can be distributed and throttled, AI training runs **push hardware to maximum utilization for days or weeks**, drawing steady high power. This is creating new stresses on grids. Utilities in major hubs like Northern Virginia and Dublin report that **soaring data center power needs are straining infrastructure and even causing delays in bringing new capacity online** ([The AI Data Center Boom: Strategies for Sustainable Growth and Risk Management](https://www.aon.com/en/insights/articles/the-ai-data-center-boom-strategies-for-sustainable-growth-and-risk-***REDACTED***#:~:text=Power%20supply%20challenges%20have%20been,10)) ([The AI Data Center Boom: Strategies for Sustainable Growth and Risk Management](https://www.aon.com/en/insights/articles/the-ai-data-center-boom-strategies-for-sustainable-growth-and-risk-***REDACTED***#:~:text=construction%20timelines%20in%20the%20state,10)). In some cases, **fossil-fueled power plants that were slated for retirement have been kept running longer specifically to supply data center growth** ([RELEASE: New report details environmental, consumer costs of data center expansion](https://environmentamerica.org/center/media-center/release-new-report-details-environmental-consumer-costs-of-data-center-expansion/#:~:text=The%20report%20identifies%20at%20least,solely%20to%20serve%20data%20centers)). For example, the **Frontier Group/U.S. PIRG report** identified at least 17 U.S. power plants (coal and gas) whose closures were postponed or reconsidered due to rising demand from new AI and crypto data centers ([RELEASE: New report details environmental, consumer costs of data center expansion](https://environmentamerica.org/center/media-center/release-new-report-details-environmental-consumer-costs-of-data-center-expansion/#:~:text=The%20report%20identifies%20at%20least,solely%20to%20serve%20data%20centers)). This contrasts with most traditional data centers which historically grew at a pace grids could more easily manage. In sum, while **cryptocurrency mining and traditional data centers set precedents** in energy use and emissions, the **AI sector is quickly catching up – and in some areas exceeding them – in scale and intensity**. AI’s impact is also more multifaceted: combining the high **energy appetite** of crypto *and* the **physical infrastructure footprint** of big data centers *and* a complex **global supply chain**. As one commentator put it, **the environmental footprint of AI is “the new oil” problem** – much like fossil fuels did, AI is challenging existing infrastructure and policies in a way that could rival those legacy industries in environmental significance ([

## Gaps and Inefficiencies in Environmental Regulation of AI Infrastructure  
The rapid rise of AI infrastructure has **outpaced the development of environmental regulations**, exposing several weaknesses in current oversight in the U.S., EU, and China. One major issue is **transparency**: there are **few mandates requiring companies to disclose data center environmental impacts** such as water usage, carbon footprint, or e-waste. In the U.S., no federal law compels reporting of data center water consumption, and many tech companies have been secretive about it – **Google even argued that its data center water use should be treated as a trade secret** to avoid public disclosure ([AI needs to reduce its water dependency - Planet Tracker](https://planet-tracker.org/ai-needs-to-reduce-its-water-dependency/#:~:text=controlling%20the%20amount%20of%20water,iv)). As a result, local communities often learn of water drawdowns or emissions *after* problems arise (for instance, residents only noticed wells running dry once data center cooling systems were already in operation). Similarly, **less than one-third of data center operators track any water-related metrics at all** ([AI needs to reduce its water dependency - Planet Tracker](https://planet-tracker.org/ai-needs-to-reduce-its-water-dependency/#:~:text=controlling%20the%20amount%20of%20water,iv)), reflecting a regulatory blind spot. On the climate side, **Scope 3 emissions (supply chain/manufacturing)** are largely unregulated; an AI firm can purchase thousands of power-hungry GPUs without any requirement to account for the **upstream CO₂ emitted in making that hardware**. These embedded emissions cross borders and aren’t addressed by standard national environmental laws, which focus on direct emitters. 

In the **European Union**, policymakers are beginning to acknowledge these gaps but are still in early stages of action. The EU’s updated **Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)** now requires larger data centers (over 500 kW IT load) to **report key sustainability metrics** – including **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), energy source, and heat reuse – to a central database** ([New Sustainability Reporting Requirements for Data Centers in the EU | Inside Energy & Environment](https://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2024/08/new-sustainability-reporting-requirements-for-data-centers-in-the-eu/#:~:text=1,and%20use%20of%20renewable%20energy)) ([New Sustainability Reporting Requirements for Data Centers in the EU | Inside Energy & Environment](https://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2024/08/new-sustainability-reporting-requirements-for-data-centers-in-the-eu/#:~:text=Annex%20III%20to%20the%20Delegated,factor%3B%20and%20renewable%20energy%20factor)). This marks the first EU-wide attempt to systematically collect data on data center resource use. However, these are **reporting requirements, not usage limits**. There is no EU-wide cap on how much water a data center can withdraw, for example; enforcement is limited to requiring transparency. Some EU member states and local governments have stepped in with ad-hoc measures (Amsterdam and Dublin temporarily paused new data center permits when power and water became constrained, and **Amsterdam now enforces a stricter WUE standard and max floor area for facilities**). But across the EU, **rules remain patchy and mostly voluntary** – for instance, the **Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact** is an industry-led agreement with sustainability targets, not a law ([Does the EU's approach to regulating data centres make sense?](https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2dckl480ygjaprin8irk0/feature/does-the-eus-approach-to-regulating-data-centres-make-sense#:~:text=Does%20the%20EU%27s%20approach%20to,on%20the%20climate%20where)). Until the new reporting framework yields publicly available data (the plan is to publish aggregated stats by country each year ([New Sustainability Reporting Requirements for Data Centers in the EU | Inside Energy & Environment](https://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2024/08/new-sustainability-reporting-requirements-for-data-centers-in-the-eu/#:~:text=Annex%20IV%20lays%20out%20which,size%20of%20different%20data%20centers))), regulators and citizens lack a clear picture of AI data centers’ impacts, making it hard to set informed policy. 

In the **United States**, environmental regulation of data centers is even **more fragmented**. Data centers often slip through regulatory cracks because individually they may not violate traditional pollution norms – they primarily consume resources (electricity, water) rather than emit noxious waste on-site. Thus, they might only be subject to basic local permits (for building, water use, or backup generator emissions under the Clean Air Act). There is **no federal standard for data center water efficiency or carbon intensity**. Instead, many U.S. states and localities have been *incentivizing* data centers with tax breaks, **rather than scrutinizing their environmental impact**. For example, **Virginia and Texas offer tax incentives on data center equipment and energy use**, effectively subsidizing their expansion ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=The%20situation%20today%20is%20the,raising%20prices%20for%20households%20and)). As the IMF pointed out, this is counterproductive: **data centers and crypto mines enjoy tax exemptions despite the environmental damage and minimal employment they bring** ([Carbon Emissions from AI and Crypto Are Surging and Tax Policy Can Help](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/08/15/carbon-emissions-from-ai-and-crypto-are-surging-and-tax-policy-can-help#:~:text=The%20situation%20today%20is%20the,raising%20prices%20for%20households%20and)). The **lack of integrated planning** means multiple new AI centers can be approved in a region without assessing cumulative impacts on water tables or grid stability. U.S. environmental laws like NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) rarely require a full environmental impact statement for a private data center unless it’s on federal land or involves federal funds. Hence, considerations such as **wildlife disruption, community water competition, or climate implications** might not be formally evaluated before construction. The result is that **policy responses tend to be reactive** – for instance, after public complaints, a county might impose limits on nighttime generator noise or mandate a water conservation plan, but **these come after problems surface, not before**.

China’s approach to regulating AI infrastructure has been focused on **energy efficiency**, with mixed success. The government set aggressive targets for data center **PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)** – striving to lower the ratio of total energy to IT energy – and many new Chinese data centers boast PUE around 1.3 or better. However, **water and land impacts have been less regulated until recently**. China **lacks a national WUE standard** for data centers (no mandated metric for water efficiency yet) ([China data center water demand to double by 2030 – report - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/china-data-center-water-demand-to-double-by-2030-report/#:~:text=China%20has%20yet%20to%20issue,4)), though some local authorities are introducing guidelines (Shanghai, for example, recommends a WUE of 1.4 ([China data center water demand to double by 2030 – report - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/china-data-center-water-demand-to-double-by-2030-report/#:~:text=China%20has%20yet%20to%20issue,4))). Moreover, enforcement of environmental rules can be inconsistent across regions. In the “**Dry 10**” provinces (the driest parts of inland China where many new data center parks are being built), local governments often prioritize economic development over conservation ([China data center water demand to double by 2030 – report - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/china-data-center-water-demand-to-double-by-2030-report/#:~:text=Only%2032%20percent%20of%20China%27s,are%20very%20prone%20to%20both)) ([China data center water demand to double by 2030 – report - DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/china-data-center-water-demand-to-double-by-2030-report/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCompetition%20for%20water%20in%20the,also%20be%20met%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20CWR)). This has led to data centers being approved in areas already suffering **water scarcity** or relying on over-tapped rivers. While China has strong central environmental directives on paper, implementation for fast-moving sectors like tech can lag. Notably, in **July 2023 China imposed export controls on gallium and germanium**, citing resource conservation – a move indicating awareness that **critical mineral supply and its environmental burden are strategic issues** ([AI Needs Critical Materials, Fast! But From Where? - JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ai-needs-critical-materials-fast-but-9868792/#:~:text=AI%20Needs%20Critical%20Materials%2C%20Fast%21,gallium%2C%20germanium%2C%20palladium%20and)) ([China's rare earths dominance in focus after it limits germanium and gallium exports | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-rare-earths-dominance-focus-after-mineral-export-curbs-2023-07-05/#:~:text=The%20chemical%20properties%20of%20rare,processing%20can%20generate%20toxic%20waste)). Yet domestically, the **extraction and processing of those minerals remain highly polluting**, and China is grappling with how to clean up these industries without losing its dominance. 

Across all regions, a key regulatory inefficiency is the **siloed nature of oversight**. **AI infrastructure spans multiple domains** – energy, water, mining, waste – but regulators and laws tend to address these impacts separately, if at all. An AI data center’s **carbon footprint is affected by global semiconductor supply chains**, which environmental regulations in the U.S. or EU do not reach. Likewise, its water use might be governed by a local utility contract rather than any broader environmental rule. **No current framework fully accounts for AI’s holistic impact.** As a result, there’s a risk of **“carbon leakage” and “water leakage”**, where companies tout renewable energy use (reducing direct emissions) while their **supplier emissions or water footprints are offloaded to countries with weaker standards**. The challenges ahead will involve bridging these regulatory gaps. But as of now, the **environmental pressures from AI are racing ahead of policy**: governance remains *voluntary, piecemeal, or reactive*, highlighting the urgent need to strengthen and update environmental regulations in the age of AI. Without such efforts, the **unchecked growth of AI infrastructure could lock in significant ecological damage** and resource burdens for decades to come, akin to the unregulated expansion of industries in the past.

# Beyond Electricity: The Hidden Environmental Pressures of AI

## High Water Usage of AI Infrastructure

- *“For example, training the GPT-3 language model in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret.”*【62†L16-L19】
- *“Even excluding the water usage in leased third-party colocation facilities, Google’s self-owned data centers alone directly withdrew 29 billion liters and consumed (i.e., evaporated) more than 23 billion liters of freshwater for on-site cooling in 2023, nearly 80% of which was potable water. This amount of annual water consumption even rivals that of a major household-name beverage company.”*【62†L68-L74】

## Rare Mineral Extraction and E-Waste Issues

- *“The electronics \[in data centers] rely on a staggering amount of raw materials – making a 2 kg computer requires 800 kg of raw materials. As well, the microchips that power AI need rare earth elements, which are often mined in environmentally destructive ways.”*【63†L219-L223】
- *“The rapid expansion of AI technology could drive electronic waste from data centers to **5 million tons annually by 2030**, according to a new study.”*【64†L130-L137】

## Land Use Conflicts and Ecosystem Impacts

- *“But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.”*【65†L120-L127】

## Carbon Footprint of AI Chip Manufacturing

- *“The energy it takes to physically manufacture a computer chip can be more than the chip consumes in its entire 10-year lifetime.”*【58†L256-L264】
- *“The manufacturing of these power-hungry chips is another significant source of \[the] semiconductor carbon footprint… AI GPUs, often multiple times larger than their consumer electronics counterparts, require advanced packaging processes that are energy-intensive and generate substantial emissions.”*【57†L179-L187】
