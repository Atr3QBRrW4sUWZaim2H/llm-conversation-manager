I’m not seeing any specific information in your question (or in the conversation so far) about *which* issues The Sun.ai Foundation was formed to combat, nor any details about the foundation’s statements, mission, or the founders’ background. Without that context, it’s difficult to identify the organization’s core beliefs accurately.

Could you share more about:

- The specific issues the foundation was formed to address?
- Any statements, mission summaries, or founding principles published by The Sun.ai Foundation?
- The backgrounds or key philosophies of the founders themselves?

With that information, I’d be happy to help piece together and articulate the founders’ core beliefs. If you can provide any text or an outline of the foundation’s aims, I can then distill it into key principles or beliefs. Otherwise, any answer I give would just be a guess rather than a faithful interpretation of the actual content.
