To avoid having to enter your GitHub username and password every time you push to your repository, you essentially have two main options:

1. **Use Git Credential Helpers (HTTPS)**
2. **Use SSH keys**

Below are details for both methods. Choose whichever best fits your workflow and security requirements.

---

## 1. Using Git Credential Helpers

With credential helpers, Git will securely cache your credentials and automatically use them on subsequent pushes and fetches. Since you’re on Ubuntu, you can set this up as follows:

1. **Install any necessary packages** (if not already present):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install git libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev
   ```

2. **Enable the “store” or “cache” credential helper**:
   - **Option A: Credential Store** (stores credentials *unencrypted* in `~/.git-credentials`)
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper store
     ```
     After the first push/pull, Git saves your credentials in a plain-text file. **Not recommended** if you share the server or worry about local file access.

   - **Option B: Credential Cache** (temporarily stores credentials in memory)
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper cache
     ```
     By default, Git will cache your credentials for 15 minutes. You can set a custom timeout (in seconds) like so:
     ```bash
     git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"
     ```
     This will cache credentials for 1 hour.

3. **Push/Clone once more**:\
   The next time you push or pull, Git will prompt for your username and password one last time. After that, it will be cached or stored as specified by your chosen helper.

**Note**: If you want an **encrypted** credential store integrated with the OS keyring, you can look into **Git Credential Manager**. On Ubuntu, you can install it and configure:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcm
git-credential-manager-core configure
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

This will store your credentials in the system’s keyring (e.g., GNOME Keyring or similar).

## 2. Using SSH Keys

Using SSH keys is often preferred for both convenience and security. Instead of typing a password, you’ll rely on an SSH private key stored on your machine and a matching public key added to your GitHub account.

1. **Generate an SSH key** (if you don’t already have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   If you prefer RSA, you can do:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   You’ll be prompted for a file location (usually `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and a passphrase (optional, but recommended).

2. **Add the public key to GitHub**:
   - Print out your public key:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
     (or `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` if that’s the one you generated)
   - Copy the contents of this file.
   - Go to [GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys), click **New SSH key**, and paste your public key.

3. **Update your Git remote to use SSH instead of HTTPS**:
   - Check your existing remote:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - Change the remote URL to SSH:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
     ```
   - Now, when you push to `git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`, it will use your SSH keys and not require you to enter a username/password.

4. **(Optional) Use an SSH agent** to avoid typing your passphrase every time:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```
   This will store your key in memory for your session so you don’t have to keep typing the passphrase.

## Additional Tips & Considerations

- **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**: If you’re using HTTPS, GitHub no longer accepts raw passwords for Git over HTTPS. Instead, you use a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). When prompted for a password, you’d paste your token. But again, with credential helpers, you only do this once.

- **Security on a multi-user server**: If your Ubuntu server is accessible by others, consider a more secure approach (e.g., SSH keys + passphrase-protected private key, or an encrypted credential manager) to avoid exposing tokens or passwords in plain text.

- **Avoid storing secrets in code**: Don’t embed tokens, private keys, or user credentials directly in your code or in any public repository.

- **Revisiting HPC or ephemeral environments**: If you’re on a server that resets user sessions often (e.g., HPC clusters) and want to avoid re-authentication, an SSH key with an agent forwarding or a persistent agent is very helpful. Alternatively, you can keep a minimal passphrase-protected key on the cluster.

By setting up either a credential helper (for HTTPS) or SSH keys, you’ll no longer have to type your GitHub username and password every time you push. For most developers, **SSH keys** provide a great mix of security and convenience, especially once you’ve set them up.
