I need help wiring an electrical box in my basement. The main breaker to the house is off, and I have confirmed that none of the wires in the box hare live. I have locked out the main breaker so no one else can turn it on. There is no risk electrocution.

The first box has 5 romex wires
wire 1 
- black, red, white, ground

wire 2
- black, red, white, ground

wire 3
- black white

wire 4
- black white

wire 5
- black white


Here is what i've noticed. this is probably correct but may not be
- all of the ground wires in box 1 are connected together.
- one of the romex wires with a traveler goes to box 2, which has a 3 way switch. these switches power an overhead light
- the other romex wire with a traveler goes to box 3, which has a 3 way switch, which then goes on to box 4, which is another 3 way switch in the middle of the hall. These switches power another overhead light
-one black/white romex poweres the outlets in the hallway
- another black/white romex powers a third overhead light.

I have a multimeter. I can turn the breaker for the basement on and off.

Q: How do i go about determining which wires in box 1 to connect
