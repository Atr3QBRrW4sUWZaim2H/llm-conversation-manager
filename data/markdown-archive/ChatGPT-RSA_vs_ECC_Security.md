What does this mean


Both RSA and ECC, two algorithms (/ sets of algorithms) that are the basis for modern internet encryption, derive their security from the fact that there is no way to solve certain (amazingly simple) number theory problems within a reasonable timespan

This statement is explaining that the security of RSA and ECC encryption comes from relying on mathematical problems that are very simple to describe but extremely hard to solve computationally. Here’s a breakdown:

- **RSA:**\
  RSA encryption is based on the fact that while it’s easy to multiply two large prime numbers together, it’s very difficult to take the product and work backward (factor it) to find the original primes. Even though prime factorization is a straightforward concept, no efficient method is known for factoring very large numbers, making the encryption secure.

- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):**\
  ECC relies on the difficulty of solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. This problem involves finding a secret number that relates two points on an elliptic curve. The math is simple to understand, but finding that secret number without the proper key takes an impractical amount of time with current technology.

- **"Within a reasonable timespan":**\
  The phrase emphasizes that, while these problems could theoretically be solved, doing so would require such an enormous amount of time (and computational power) that it’s not feasible for any attacker. This impracticality is what keeps modern internet communications secure.

In essence, even though the underlying mathematical problems are conceptually simple, their computational complexity in practice ensures that encrypted data remains safe from attackers.
