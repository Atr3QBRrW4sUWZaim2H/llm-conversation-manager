    Wonderful Honeymoon Time in Kyoto!
    The staff was incredible and the hotel was beautiful! A thoughtful note was on our bed and we received complimentary drinks for our honeymoon! I’m typically a tough critic but I absolutely loved my stay and enjoyed the wonderful performance by the Maiko. She even came to dinner and took pictures with us afterwards :) so glad we chose this hotel!

    Fabulous hotel in a fabulous city!
    Fantastic location, doesn’t take long to walk to some of the best sites. Rooms were comfortable, room service was very very good and concierge was outstanding. So impressed with the level of English spoken. What an excellent hotel. Couldn’t fault it. Just the hairdryers need upgrading. Other than that, a wonderful place to stay when visiting Kyoto!

    Our home base when visiting Kyoto
    Our 4th stay-this time for 11 nights. Fantastic location and is actually next door to one of the most amazing temples in Kyoto and a 5 minute walk to a must-do 6am morning service at another temple. Ewe enjoy being out of the downtown big city chaos and the Hyatt Regency, Kyoto provides us with all the luxury we could possibly need!!

    One of the most enjoyable hotel stays ever.
    The positive experience started from arrival as we were warmly welcomed by all Hotel staff with Dennis leading the way. The engagement by all staff was truly first class. The rooms we had were lovely, spacious with a fantastic outlook on the garden area. Breakfast was of the highest quality. The bar downstairs was sophisticated, and service was again excellent. Location was good by being quite central to many temples and the centre - just a 1.5 kilometre walk to the station.

    Great hotel
    It is in a convenient location the bus stop is ant the hotel front and 10 minutes of walk to subway/train station. The hotel also has third party luggage delivery services which can send your luggage to airport or next hotel same day. It is very helpful if you plan to stop some where before your next destination.

    Great Hotel in a perfect Location!! Ideal place to go in Kyoto
    Hyatt Regency Kyoto is an excellent Hotel to stay in Kyoto. The hotel is great, reasonably priced compared to nearby hotels. The restaurants/food is excellent and the location of the Hotel is perfect. We came to stay here a second time. The rooms are very nice. The breakfast cafe was very good and the staff was very helpful. The check and the concierge were very efficient and helpful. They helped us in locating some great places to eat in. Most of the important tourist destinations are in walking distance. Overall an excellent place to stay. You get a full sense of the city staying here.

    Amazing hotel
    The hotel is very kid friendly and staffs are extremely professional and detail oriented. Also have maiko performance periodically which is super cool. Breakfast is delicious. Their cookies and break from the bakery is delicious. Highly recommend.

    Lovely hotel on Nanajo
    Got a room facing the beautiful zen garden. It is a really nice hotel. If you are willing to walk and take buses, there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel with a bus to Kyoto Station (crowded and took 20 min) and an 9 minute walk to a subway station.

    Hyatt Regency Kyoto review
    The Hyatt regency in Kyoto was the perfect hotel to explore Kyoto from. The staff were great, the rooms wonderful, and the breakfast and bar were great. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Kyoto.

    Best time in historic Kyoto
    Excellent location, services, food and experience. Plus I get to watch performances by a real maiko at the hotel lobby! What a treat! The place is within walking distance of so many historic sites in Kyoto so it it really convenient. Too bad the museum just opposite was closed if not it will be perfect.

    Highly recommended
    Beautiful hotel inside, using typical Japanese wood. The rooms were clean and kept in great condition. The restaurants are good with lots of healthy options. The gym is well equipped with a range of strength and cardio machines. The hotel is a bit out of the city but we liked that because of the quietness. The staff were very helpful and attended to our every need. Highly recommended.

    Great location, fantastic service, wonderful food, exceptional staff
    The Hyatt Regency Kyoto exceeded our expectations in so many ways. We loved the following things, breakfast in Cafe 33, the quality of food in all the restaurants, our two dinner meals at Trattoria Sette, one meal at Touzan, sophisticated drinks (with a great selection of Japanese fine whiskies) in the Touzan bar. We also loved the Maiko performance in the lobby of the Toucan restaurant. Seeing a Maiko performance is not something that most western tourists get the opportunity to experience. Thank you to Hyatt for providing the guests with a wonderful and unique Maiko performance. It was one of the highlights of our entire trip. We loved that we got to meet the Maiko also. The hotel is a nice location with easy access to all the main tourist attractions. Pro tip: Have the hose shipped your luggage to your next hotel. It is so freeing to not have to lug your large luggage pieces onto the trains.

    Wonderful Experience!
    It was a beatiful stay! We were there to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and couldn't have asked for a better stay. From check in to check out, everyone was very attentive and helpful. Concierge helped us map a few things and gave us excellent recommendations. Our room was beautiful and spacious...and we love that we were in a quieter area of Kyoto

    Great Hotel Choice
    First rate experience all-around. Beautiful customer experience. Treated personally and with great feeling. Breakfast buffet is an extravagant bonanza and the Italian restaurant is superb. Not in center but easily near trains and buses and Gion and Kyoto station are 15-20 minutes walks, which we did numerous times.

    Great 5 star experience close to the best of Kyoto
    This hotel was a great 5 star experience all around, from its excellent staff (Dennis the concierge was great!), the design of the interior, the food options, and it's in an excellent location next to Kiyomizu-dera. You can easily walk to that area which is full of shops and restaurants, as well as the famous temple. The train access is quite good, a short 5 to 8 minute walk to the Shichijo station with the Keihan line.

    Friendly and helpful staff. Good, clean, well maintained hotel.
    We really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Although they didn't offer any suit upgrades to us being Hyatt Globalist and the room that we got was a little small compares other Hyatt's, the staffs made up for it by being super friendly and welcoming. While we were there, they had a traditional Gisa dancing performance in one of the evenings with free drinks. It was very nice after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel concierge was very knowledgeable of the area and made good recommendations. She actually helped us booked a table in advance before we arrived to Kyoto. It was a Michelin rated restaurant and without that reservation, it would not have been possible to get a table because they are always booked don't accept walk-ins. So we were very appreciative of being able to try a very nice dinner. The hotel breakfast was very comprehensive, it had both western and Japanese buffets to choose from. The hotel is located in close proximity to major temples that you can get to by foot. But due to rain, we opted for taxis trips. Our experience with riding in taxis were very nice and smooth too. The hotel staff flagged down the taxi for us and let the driver know our destination, they also check with the driver whether he can accept credit card payments. All taxis are metered so we felt very assured of the price charged and what form of payment we chose to use. Most trips to the major tourist destination cost around 10-20 USD.

    Beautiful hotel, excellent staff, great restaurants, good value for money. The decor lent a feel of a luxury hotel which I wasn't expecting from a Hyatt Regency. Location was very good, and a free taxi was provided from the Shinkasen station.

    Still dreaming of the French toast !!
    Get an Upgraded suite - it’s much bigger and better than the regular rooms. You get a wrap around Balcony and expanded bathroom with bathtub overlooking a koi pond. Absolutely get the Japanese French toast with blueberry compote it is to die for! Even if you’re normally not a French toast person it’s a must try! After 7am breakfast gets busy so go early or be prepared to wait a little bit.

    Location and staff made the stay.
    Great location with many historical sites in walking distance. Breakfast was good and the staff was helpful and polite all the time. I5 would be nice if they moved the bar to the lobby from the lower level, but I would recommend for business travel and would return if I am sent to Kyoto again.

    Lovely Stay as Always
    I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the incredible staff at Hyatt Regency Kyoto for making my stay unforgettable. As a Globalist, I was truly impressed by the warm hospitality and the fantastic room upgrade, which made my experience even more special. Every detail, from the seamless check-in to the luxurious accommodations, exceeded my expectations. The team’s attentiveness and care created a truly memorable experience, and I can’t wait to return. Thank you for making my stay so remarkable!

    Service at a full-service hotel the way it should be.
    We had an extended stay of six nights at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto. The front-end staff had arranged a car service to pick us up at Osaka International. The pick-up was exactly as arranged and so began an extremely enjoyable stay at a hotel where the idea of guest service is still the top priority.

    The hotel is nicely designed with both modern and Kyoto traditional style. Room is spacious, clean and nice. Love the bath robe, very cute and comfortable.

    Excellent stay
    Stayed for 12 nights. Enjoyed it very much. I was a solo traveller but room was stocked every day for 2 people by the excellent housekeeping. Good 24 hr gym. Breakfast extensive, was busy but they did change the start to 6.30am which really helped l. 20 to 30 minute walk to Gion, Kyoto station and downtown. There are buses outside but I do try leave them for the poor locals as they are very busy. Staff, as with everywhere in Japan, excellent. Food quality always good. Only thing I would mention, as have others, the carpets are beige, although they do match with the aesthetic of the room, they were badly stained which spoils the fact the rooms are actually cleaned extremely well by housekeeping. That was my only niggle, everything else, I loved

    Complementary taxi service from the train station started out our stay at Hyatt Regency Kyoto. Delicious meals and superb service at Touzan, Trattoria Sette, and Cafe 33 made for a great stay. Bus stops in front of the hotel were convenient and used by our family often. The Maiko performance at the hotel was a cultural experience enjoyed by the whole family.

    Great experience!
    The staff at this hotel is top notch. Great at anticipating our needs and providing great service with a smile. The room and bed were very comfortable with many amenities. There was a hosted geisha performance in the hotel which was interesting to see as I probably would not have sought out that experience myself but I was glad to have the opportunity to get the experience. The location is very good. A 3-4 block walk to the train to Fushimi Inari and about a 20 minute walk to Kiyumizu Dera. Pretty easy to get to shopping areas, like where the new Nintendo shop is. 1000-1200 yen taxi ride to Tokyo station. Right on a main thoroughfare for buses. Ample taxi availability. There is a temple with 1001 statues of the deity Kannon and also a museum (good rainy day activity) across the street.

    Beautiful property, helpful staff, and incredible location!
    My husband and I recently stayed during a visit to Kyoto in June 2024. The hotel is walkable (about 15-20 mins) from the nearest station and upon arriving, we were immediately greeted by the lobby staff and helped with our bags. The team here is sensational and gave us a very warm welcome! The hotel itself has a few restaurant options. We had drinks and appetizers at the lobby-level restaurant which were great, and made a few purchases from the onsite Patisserie which were fantastic! The room itself was clean, modern, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The rooms had ample amenities, however there was not an iron or ironing board provided (this is pretty typical in Western-style hotels and something I've come to expect, so I was a little surprised this wasn't available). The view from the room was beautiful, overlooking the nearby temples and city. The location of the hotel is exceptional; it is conveniently located with a bus stop right outside (including hop-on hop-off tour bus) and is within a very short walking distance of the National Museum. We didn't have a chance to visit, but we did visit the Sanjūsangendō Temple up the street and this is HIGHLY recommended. We are in our 30s and enjoy walking around the city, so the Gion area and other sightseeing locations were only a short walk away. For rainy days, we simply caught the bus at one of the nearby stops which was very affordable and easy to get to from the hotel. When we return to Kyoto, we will certainly stay in this location again and highly recommend this spot to those looking for a convenient, comfortable stay in the area. The staff were wonderful, rooms were clean and spacious, and we had a great time!

    Perfect hotel stay for our first adventure in Kyoto.
    My family and I truly had a spectacular stay at this amazing and beautiful hotel. Our rooms were gorgeous, very clean and quite large (compared to what we had just previously experienced in Tokyo), the staff was exceptional, the food fantastic, the bar delightful, the concierge team amazing (truly the best in all of Japan!) and the location of the hotel itself couldn't have been more perfect. Our experience at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto made our first time in this magical city absolutely perfect. We will definitely come back to Kyoto and we'll definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency again when we do. Thank you to General Manager Tim O'Driscoll and his wonderful staff for providing us with such a memorable and wonderful experience.

    Exceeded Expections
    I was a bit worried reading some of the reviews but my experience was different. The hotel is not a 5 star and the smell of an old carpet is there the first time you get to your room but after a while it just goes away. Amenities in the room are perfect. Shower and tub are excellent. Pillows are terrible so ask for more pillows if you need additional support. Hotel is close to everything. The bus 206 will take you to Gion and downtown area. It is a 10 minute bus ride from the Kyoto station. There is a subway not too far and a McDonald's for those who like fast American food. There is a cart with coffee and croissant for early risers. We took advantage of it when we started our day at 6:30am.

    Loved our stay at the Hyatt Regency! For work I’m often staying in Marriott properties but I had some Hyatt points and was able to snag this property. The staff were incredible from arrival to departure and the location was amazing - close enough to walk or use public transit to the main areas, but far enough away that it’s quiet for a peaceful night’s sleep.

    Cultural Experience
    The hotel in Gion exceeded my expectations and was very zen and calming while providing exceptional service. The Maiko performance and champagne was a lovely welcoming touch. There was so much to do within walking distance of this hotel.

    Best experience I ever had
    This is one of the best hotel experience my wife and I ever had. We were here for our honeymoon and the staff were so great and accommodating. The location was close to the Kyoto station and buses were able to take us to different parts of Kyoto. We can't wait for our next trip here

    Lovely Gem in Kyoto !
    Located not far from the main eating & shopping strips.. short taxi ride to the famous temples & shrines. Lovely hotel with excellent customer service staff who is very responsive to your requests. Highly recommended if you are a couple or a quiet business trip away from the crowd.

    Prime location, outstanding staff
    The hotel is situated with walking distance of major attractions in Kyoto, including the Gion district. We received outstanding service from the hotel staff throughout our stay. Will definitely choose the hotel again for our next trip to Kyoto.

    Great place to stay in Kyoto
    I loved my time at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto. The hotel is conveniently located close to Gion (walking distance) and a ton of site seeing destinations. However, the best part of this hotel is the amazing staff. We felt so catered to and well taken care of! The spa was beautiful and the team was so helpful arranging last minute appts.

    Having a stress free stay in Kyoto
    The beauty of Kyoto is to be observed slowly with your eyes wide open. You can’t visit the city in one day, it would not be fair to you as a visitor. My wife and I enjoy exploring a city through public transportation, it’s a great way to discover the heart and soul. Don’t rush through, take your time and find your own path .

    Great Kyoto Christmas Experience
    Was Lucky enough to book Hyatt Regency Kyoto for our family's Christmas. The Dinner in Touzan was fabulous, service impeccable with a Zen Garden evening view to match the meal -- what more could we have asked for. best part, Maiko performance and "hosting our dinner" -- great surprise. Efficient staff , Kyoto-esque old world great service. Tip : try the salted Cod roe pasta at Cafe33

    FB staff Yu was excellent! She deserves special mention! Extremely sincere, warm and attentive. Exemplary! The rooms will a balcony face foliage and have a mini onsen like tub, the decor is minimalist zen which is restful . Beds are comfortable. They could be more generous with the soaps, shampoos. Have them in larger vessels. The breakfast was excellent. Offerings included ordering a hot western or Japanese breakfast as well as the buffet spread. Staff worked extremely hard over Christmas. Well done!

    A fabulous experience
    Great hotel, great staff, great location. We loved the room - clean, quiet, and well-designed. For first-timers to Japan, the language can be intimidating. But everyone we encountered was friendly, kind, and helpful. Dining options allowed us to gently become familiar with Japanese cuisine. Our stay was probably the best hotel experience we have ever had.

    100 % recommended Location, Service, Comfort, cleanliness!!! This hotel has everything
    We were in love with this hotel, location, service, comfort, cleanliness, this hotel has everything. Location, it is right in the middle of everything. Taxis are affordable since everything is close by, it has two bus stops right in front of the hotel and it has a very good atmosphere. Service was impeccable. The person that greeds you was always there and making sure you get on and off of your rides, the front desks personal were attentive, friendly and supportive, the concierge were very helpful and gave us the recommendations that we were looking for. Clean and comfortable, the hotel, rooms and common areas were clean and organized at all times, the rooms were very comfortable, with space, modern and with a beautiful design. 100% recommended

    An amazing hotel in a great location
    The service in the hotel was perfect! All the staff were very friendly and happy to help with any questions or requests. Everyone was able to speak English very well, so it is a very welcoming place for tourists who don’t know very much Japanese. The room was clean and very spacious. The walled garden helped to cut down on the noise from the city, so I was always able to sleep really well. It is also perfectly located for visiting all the sights around Kyoto. It’s about 5 minutes’ walk away from the subway system, and there are bus stops just outside the entrance. All of the biggest sites are within around 30 minutes of public transportation, so you can visit a lot of places in a short amount of time. The on-site restaurants cater to many different tastes. Cafe 33 is the main dining area, which serves buffet breakfasts in the morning, and then an all-day menu featuring east-meets-west dishes like chicken kara age sandwiches, wagyu steak and chips and pork katsu curry. The 2nd floor features an Italian restaurant featuring various authentic pizzas and pastas. Finally, there is a Japanese restaurant on the basement floor. This serves high-end Japanese cuisine, with a lot of variety to choose from. With the opportunity to see a free Maiko (an apprentice Geisha) performance every Tues, Thurs & Sat, this hotel was a joy to stay in, and I cannot recommend it enough!

    Luxury hotel within walking distance of museums and temples
    We have never had more attentive bell services. Riho and her team absolutely went above and beyond. There was a problem with something we shipped and she took it to the shipping place so it would arrive on time. The kitchen staff was amazing! Every morning it was like watching a finely choreographed ballet. Chefs would visit us at our table, special requests were no problem. If we were a few minutes late they would let us order off the menu. The managers were incredibly friendly and always visible. The servers and bussers seemed to be enjoying themselves, laughing an having a great time. The food was unbelievable! I don’t like salad, but the chef made such a great salad I enjoyed it! The waffles were wonderful with strawberry sauce and maple syrup. They had a fresh squeezed juice offering that varied every day. We can’t wait to come back! There was also a Maiko performance that was beautifully staged. We are so glad we got to see it! We also wish to thank Sherpa, our server who memorized our breakfast order and was so welcoming she made us feel like family.

    Excellent Hotel
    We spent 7 nights at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto and loved it for its spacious, quiet and elegant room. and excellent service. The staff were professional, friendly and responsive to any request. The food was delicious at all the restaurants. We enjoyed the Italian restaurant, the afternoon tea and the cafe for lunch and the breakfast buffet. We often walked or took a taxi to Kyoto Station to explore different areas near Kyoto (Hiroshima, Himeiji, Arashimaya, Nara) and took the nearby subway to explore within Kyoto or the Hop On Hop Off Bus with a stop right next to the hotel.

    Excellent hospitality
    From the moment we exited the taxi we were greeted and provided the best customer service. The room and amenities were great. We rented two bikes from the hotel and spent the day exploring. Definitely recommend that as a mode of transportation for a different perspective of the city.

    My favorite Hyatt Regency in the world
    I love this Hyatt Regency! It’s the only hotel I/we stayed while in Kyoto for many many times! It’s in a quiet location next to the national museum and relatively close to the Kyoto Station. The hotel is beautifully designed. The rooms are small but clean and neat with comfortable beds. They offer great breakfast and all day dining. The staff is always helpful.

    Excellent location and reliable room
    The location of this hotel can not be surpassed and was in walking distance to many of the sightseeing highlights of Kyoto. The hotel itself was underwhelming in architecture and structure, but clean and comfortable. We also stayed at the Aman Kyoto, which was obviously a more elevated experienced, but the Hyatt rooms were clean, comfortable, and the breakfast was fantastic. The concierge is unreliable and only 1 person staffing the entire hotel.

    We enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again when visiting Tokyo. The hotel staff were very helpful, the room decor was lovely and the hotel dining was excellent. You may want to request a room on the third floor or above. The second floor rooms are below ground level and are a bit dark. There is bamboo planted outside of the windows which is nice though.

    Great Property
    I really enjoyed my stay here in January 2024. The staff are great, the breakfast is exceptional, the Maiko show was great to watch, the free taxi ride from the train station to the hotel is super nice, and the vibes at the Bar in the basement were great. Special shout out to the breakfast manager for helping our group with to-go iced coffees on our final day. Very kind! My only gripe is about their wifi and odd hotel setup. The wi-fi was incredibly slow and the front desk staff said they would have IT take a look at it the next day, but we were checking out the next day. The hotel is built weird so you have to take a few different elevators to get to the gym, but the gym itself was nice and well stocked.

    Great hotel and customer service
    Hotel was in a secluded area. Hotel was clean and presented well. Staff showed good customer service and greeted us each time we entered the lobby area. The Maiko performance was excellent. We had the Japanese breakfast one morning for 4,500 JPY. It had a lot of regional Japanese selections and completed well by the rest of the buffet. The king bed room was really spacious and allowed us to open our suitcases. The location is quiet but you need to walk or catch the local bus to get to attractions. Once you get used to the the bus, its really convenient as it takes you directly to Kyoto Station.

    Hyatt points not effective
    I’ve booked at the hotel reception my three nights, but I was made to pay two of those nights. The hotel argue that my reservation was made using cash instead of points, even though this was made with the assistance of Hyatt front desk personnel. At my check out Mr. Kazuto Terramoto- Room manager- was very rood and couldn’t care lees to try to resolve my situation. I’ve paid and left with a very disappointing feeling. Due to the massive tourists amounts the hotel is enjoying full occupancy, at the expense of not being able to deliver an average service. The hotel is already showing it’s age, it looks from a 90’s movie. Thanks

    drab hotel that's a bit out of the way
    At over $400 per night, I was disappointed. During check-in, the front desk staff were confused, they had trouble answering simple questions. my room as it turned out was on the lower level, strange since a restaurant and bar were also there. rooms were drab, sink was about a foot lower than standard sink (this wasn't an accessible room), bathroom tiles were apparently replaced with wrong sizes. And you have to step into this large tub for a shower, and the curtain doesn't really properly contain the water. Overall, just a bland place

    American hotel experience in Kyoto
    Avoid this property if you want a Japanese experience. This feels more like a Hyatt in New York or Atlanta than one in Kyoto. Be ready for the minimum. Rooms are basic. Breakfast is better than in the USA but not by much. Service is good but overall you can get a much better value at most hotels in Kyoto.

    Large spider in my room
    Woke up to find a LARGE spider on the wall next to my bed. I took a picture before I killed it. My son paid for the room but forgot to show the staff the spider. The room was clean otherwise, but this was very unsettling.

    There are better options in Kyoto
    Can't really suggest this hotel based on the cost per night for an upscale room vs. what you get for that cost. The hotel itself is older and the rooms could use a refresh and the room rate just seemed outrageous vs. what you get when compared to other hotels. The noise level was another surprise as the windows in the room seemed so thin, you hear all the road noise and even the 'gong' that goes off at 5am each day from the temple beside it. Also be prepared for unexpected charges as we had a 16,500 "service charge" per night as well as the 14,300 "room consumption tax" per night. Both the Service and food quality we experienced at the Italian restaurant was very poor. Dining for breakfast at the main Cafe was fine with good service and decent food. Overall there are better choices in Kyoto.

    If you’re looking for a luxury hotel this isn’t it. I’d suggest a local Japanese hotel. The service was mid and so was the atmosphere. Breakfast was also underwhelming.

    Hyatt experience in Kyoto was disappointing
    I know it’s not Park Hyatt but for a Japanese hotel the carpet was stained and dirty. Only two bottle of water in an extremely hot week while we were staying in Kyoto. Breakfast staff was chaotic and toast did not come with an entree of eggs. They force you to the $5500 yen buffet option. The food was very average for what they charge.

    Dirty carpet in room, argue for decent room
    I was given want felt like a subterranean room adjacent to the restaurant so could hear constant clattering on the second floor. As an Amex Platinum card holder, was told no upgrade available until I insisted they try. When I asked if there was a pool, the direct responses was, “This is not a luxury hotel, if you wanted that go to the Park Hyatt.” The pluses: excellent breakfast, nice sheets. Stained carpet in room grossed me out.

    Gamble - personally never again
    Location is great, customer service is down, hotel is starting to look tired. We were booked for 6 nights and this was our 2nd stay (previous for 6 nights in 2023). This time around, 1st night we were allocated a dirty room/ stinky corridor (mould/ big water stain under AC unit, visible big stain on carpets, bubbly walls). We were moved for 1 night after wasting 1 hour complaining to reception. 2nd night, our personal belongings (travel bag) had been shoved into a cupboard onto of our luggage and shoes moved to accommodate another guests 6 pieces of luggage! Another wasted 1 hour, having to complain to management and request luggage to be moved. Very little Customer attention/ care throughout the hotel, bar one Albanian gentleman at reception. Attitude was "human error" - which we would accept if their luggage had simply been dumped in the room, but the staff had moved our travel bag from chair to a cupboard and placed it on top of our luggage, our shoes had been moved, our personal belongings were scattered throughout the room - clearly the room was occupied. Compensation offered 900 YEN taxi to station on last day (8 USD ha ha ha) - we weren't sure if they were joking or trying to insult. Email from manager was "sorry we didn't meet your high expectations" - sorry but since when wanting a clean room is high expectations!? Shame as we were in same hotel in 2023 for 6 nights, but seems the hotel is gone down. We are or I should say were loyal Hyatt members - it made no difference whatsoever. Location is great but that's about the only positive thing I can say. Unfortunately, we cannot load the video of the other guests belongings...

    OLD/Dated property. Do not recommend
    Very old, dated rooms. Bathrooms were horrible and needs upgrading badly. Grouts between tiles missing, mold growing, room furniture dated and damaged. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Staff very biased towards people of color. Staff needs training badly and property needs upgrade. Does not meet Hyatt standard at all. Location not great either.

    Location is so good, quite, warm environment and near the train station. It is not far from the main shopping center, Kyoto station and easy access to many of tourist attractions. The staff are the great asset to the property, they are so helpful, polite and friendly. Hotel provides the free taxi to the hotel upon arrival near Kyoto station. The room is comfortable and clean. Breakfast option is various and our favourite is Japanese breakfast.

    Wonderful Honeymoon Time in Kyoto!
    The staff was incredible and the hotel was beautiful! A thoughtful note was on our bed and we received complimentary drinks for our honeymoon! I’m typically a tough critic but I absolutely loved my stay and enjoyed the wonderful performance by the Maiko. She even came to dinner and took pictures with us afterwards :) so glad we chose this hotel!

    Fabulous hotel in a fabulous city!
    Fantastic location, doesn’t take long to walk to some of the best sites. Rooms were comfortable, room service was very very good and concierge was outstanding. So impressed with the level of English spoken. What an excellent hotel. Couldn’t fault it. Just the hairdryers need upgrading. Other than that, a wonderful place to stay when visiting Kyoto!

    Our home base when visiting Kyoto
    Our 4th stay-this time for 11 nights. Fantastic location and is actually next door to one of the most amazing temples in Kyoto and a 5 minute walk to a must-do 6am morning service at another temple. Ewe enjoy being out of the downtown big city chaos and the Hyatt Regency, Kyoto provides us with all the luxury we could possibly need!!

    One of the most enjoyable hotel stays ever.
    The positive experience started from arrival as we were warmly welcomed by all Hotel staff with Dennis leading the way. The engagement by all staff was truly first class. The rooms we had were lovely, spacious with a fantastic outlook on the garden area. Breakfast was of the highest quality. The bar downstairs was sophisticated, and service was again excellent. Location was good by being quite central to many temples and the centre - just a 1.5 kilometre walk to the station.

    Great hotel
    It is in a convenient location the bus stop is ant the hotel front and 10 minutes of walk to subway/train station. The hotel also has third party luggage delivery services which can send your luggage to airport or next hotel same day. It is very helpful if you plan to stop some where before your next destination.

    Great Hotel in a perfect Location!! Ideal place to go in Kyoto
    Hyatt Regency Kyoto is an excellent Hotel to stay in Kyoto. The hotel is great, reasonably priced compared to nearby hotels. The restaurants/food is excellent and the location of the Hotel is perfect. We came to stay here a second time. The rooms are very nice. The breakfast cafe was very good and the staff was very helpful. The check and the concierge were very efficient and helpful. They helped us in locating some great places to eat in. Most of the important tourist destinations are in walking distance. Overall an excellent place to stay. You get a full sense of the city staying here.

    The hotel is very kid friendly and staffs are extremely professional and detail oriented. Also have maiko performance periodically which is super cool. Breakfast is delicious. Their cookies and break from the bakery is delicious. Highly recommend.

    Lovely hotel on Nanajo
    Got a room facing the beautiful zen garden. It is a really nice hotel. If you are willing to walk and take buses, there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel with a bus to Kyoto Station (crowded and took 20 min) and an 9 minute walk to a subway station.

    Hyatt Regency Kyoto review
    The Hyatt regency in Kyoto was the perfect hotel to explore Kyoto from. The staff were great, the rooms wonderful, and the breakfast and bar were great. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Kyoto.

    Best time in historic Kyoto
    Excellent location, services, food and experience. Plus I get to watch performances by a real maiko at the hotel lobby! What a treat! The place is within walking distance of so many historic sites in Kyoto so it it really convenient. Too bad the museum just opposite was closed if not it will be perfect.

    Beautiful hotel inside, using typical Japanese wood. The rooms were clean and kept in great condition. The restaurants are good with lots of healthy options. The gym is well equipped with a range of strength and cardio machines. The hotel is a bit out of the city but we liked that because of the quietness. The staff were very helpful and attended to our every need. Highly recommended.

    Great location, fantastic service, wonderful food, exceptional staff
    The Hyatt Regency Kyoto exceeded our expectations in so many ways. We loved the following things, breakfast in Cafe 33, the quality of food in all the restaurants, our two dinner meals at Trattoria Sette, one meal at Touzan, sophisticated drinks (with a great selection of Japanese fine whiskies) in the Touzan bar. We also loved the Maiko performance in the lobby of the Toucan restaurant. Seeing a Maiko performance is not something that most western tourists get the opportunity to experience. Thank you to Hyatt for providing the guests with a wonderful and unique Maiko performance. It was one of the highlights of our entire trip. We loved that we got to meet the Maiko also. The hotel is a nice location with easy access to all the main tourist attractions. Pro tip: Have the hose shipped your luggage to your next hotel. It is so freeing to not have to lug your large luggage pieces onto the trains.

    Great Hotel Choice
    First rate experience all-around. Beautiful customer experience. Treated personally and with great feeling. Breakfast buffet is an extravagant bonanza and the Italian restaurant is superb. Not in center but easily near trains and buses and Gion and Kyoto station are 15-20 minutes walks, which we did numerous times.

    Great 5 star experience close to the best of Kyoto
    This hotel was a great 5 star experience all around, from its excellent staff (Dennis the concierge was great!), the design of the interior, the food options, and it's in an excellent location next to Kiyomizu-dera. You can easily walk to that area which is full of shops and restaurants, as well as the famous temple. The train access is quite good, a short 5 to 8 minute walk to the Shichijo station with the Keihan line.

    Friendly and helpful staff. Good, clean, well maintained hotel.
    We really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Although they didn't offer any suit upgrades to us being Hyatt Globalist and the room that we got was a little small compares other Hyatt's, the staffs made up for it by being super friendly and welcoming. While we were there, they had a traditional Gisa dancing performance in one of the evenings with free drinks. It was very nice after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel concierge was very knowledgeable of the area and made good recommendations. She actually helped us booked a table in advance before we arrived to Kyoto. It was a Michelin rated restaurant and without that reservation, it would not have been possible to get a table because they are always booked don't accept walk-ins. So we were very appreciative of being able to try a very nice dinner. The hotel breakfast was very comprehensive, it had both western and Japanese buffets to choose from. The hotel is located in close proximity to major temples that you can get to by foot. But due to rain, we opted for taxis trips. Our experience with riding in taxis were very nice and smooth too. The hotel staff flagged down the taxi for us and let the driver know our destination, they also check with the driver whether he can accept credit card payments. All taxis are metered so we felt very assured of the price charged and what form of payment we chose to use. Most trips to the major tourist destination cost around 10-20 USD.

    Still dreaming of the French toast !!
    Get an Upgraded suite - it’s much bigger and better than the regular rooms. You get a wrap around Balcony and expanded bathroom with bathtub overlooking a koi pond. Absolutely get the Japanese French toast with blueberry compote it is to die for! Even if you’re normally not a French toast person it’s a must try! After 7am breakfast gets busy so go early or be prepared to wait a little bit.

Every detail, from the seamless check-in to the luxurious accommodations, exceeded my expectations. The team’s attentiveness and care created a truly memorable experience, and I can’t wait to return.

    Service at a full-service hotel the way it should be.
    We had an extended stay of six nights at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto. The front-end staff had arranged a car service to pick us up at Osaka International. The pick-up was exactly as arranged and so began an extremely enjoyable stay at a hotel where the idea of guest service is still the top priority.

    Excellent stay
    Stayed for 12 nights. Enjoyed it very much. I was a solo traveller but room was stocked every day for 2 people by the excellent housekeeping. Good 24 hr gym. Breakfast extensive, was busy but they did change the start to 6.30am which really helped l. 20 to 30 minute walk to Gion, Kyoto station and downtown. There are buses outside but I do try leave them for the poor locals as they are very busy. Staff, as with everywhere in Japan, excellent. Food quality always good. Only thing I would mention, as have others, the carpets are beige, although they do match with the aesthetic of the room, they were badly stained which spoils the fact the rooms are actually cleaned extremely well by housekeeping. That was my only niggle, everything else, I loved

    Complementary taxi service from the train station started out our stay at Hyatt Regency Kyoto. Delicious meals and superb service at Touzan, Trattoria Sette, and Cafe 33 made for a great stay. Bus stops in front of the hotel were convenient and used by our family often. The Maiko performance at the hotel was a cultural experience enjoyed by the whole family.

    Great experience!
    The staff at this hotel is top notch. Great at anticipating our needs and providing great service with a smile. The room and bed were very comfortable with many amenities. There was a hosted geisha performance in the hotel which was interesting to see as I probably would not have sought out that experience myself but I was glad to have the opportunity to get the experience. The location is very good. A 3-4 block walk to the train to Fushimi Inari and about a 20 minute walk to Kiyumizu Dera. Pretty easy to get to shopping areas, like where the new Nintendo shop is. 1000-1200 yen taxi ride to Tokyo station. Right on a main thoroughfare for buses. Ample taxi availability. There is a temple with 1001 statues of the deity Kannon and also a museum (good rainy day activity) across the street.

    Beautiful property, helpful staff, and incredible location!
    My husband and I recently stayed during a visit to Kyoto in June 2024. The hotel is walkable (about 15-20 mins) from the nearest station and upon arriving, we were immediately greeted by the lobby staff and helped with our bags. The team here is sensational and gave us a very warm welcome! The hotel itself has a few restaurant options. We had drinks and appetizers at the lobby-level restaurant which were great, and made a few purchases from the onsite Patisserie which were fantastic! The room itself was clean, modern, and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The rooms had ample amenities, however there was not an iron or ironing board provided (this is pretty typical in Western-style hotels and something I've come to expect, so I was a little surprised this wasn't available). The view from the room was beautiful, overlooking the nearby temples and city. The location of the hotel is exceptional; it is conveniently located with a bus stop right outside (including hop-on hop-off tour bus) and is within a very short walking distance of the National Museum. We didn't have a chance to visit, but we did visit the Sanjūsangendō Temple up the street and this is HIGHLY recommended. We are in our 30s and enjoy walking around the city, so the Gion area and other sightseeing locations were only a short walk away. For rainy days, we simply caught the bus at one of the nearby stops which was very affordable and easy to get to from the hotel. When we return to Kyoto, we will certainly stay in this location again and highly recommend this spot to those looking for a convenient, comfortable stay in the area. The staff were wonderful, rooms were clean and spacious, and we had a great time!

    My family and I truly had a spectacular stay at this amazing and beautiful hotel. Our rooms were gorgeous, very clean and quite large (compared to what we had just previously experienced in Tokyo), the staff was exceptional, the food fantastic, the bar delightful, the concierge team amazing (truly the best in all of Japan!) and the location of the hotel itself couldn't have been more perfect. Our experience at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto made our first time in this magical city absolutely perfect. We will definitely come back to Kyoto and we'll definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency again when we do. Thank you to General Manager Tim O'Driscoll and his wonderful staff for providing us with such a memorable and wonderful experience.

    Exceeded Expections
    I was a bit worried reading some of the reviews but my experience was different. The hotel is not a 5 star and the smell of an old carpet is there the first time you get to your room but after a while it just goes away. Amenities in the room are perfect. Shower and tub are excellent. Pillows are terrible so ask for more pillows if you need additional support. Hotel is close to everything. The bus 206 will take you to Gion and downtown area. It is a 10 minute bus ride from the Kyoto station. There is a subway not too far and a McDonald's for those who like fast American food. There is a cart with coffee and croissant for early risers. We took advantage of it when we started our day at 6:30am.

    The beauty of Kyoto is to be observed slowly with your eyes wide open. You can’t visit the city in one day, it would not be fair to you as a visitor. My wife and I enjoy exploring a city through public transportation, it’s a great way to discover the heart and soul. Don’t rush through, take your time and find your own path .

But everyone we encountered was friendly, kind, and helpful. Dining options allowed us to gently become familiar with Japanese cuisine. Our stay was probably the best hotel experience we have ever had.

    Sublime :)
    The customer service was outstanding as were the rooms and the delicious food - especially at the Italian restaurant. Plus I had a lovely Japanese style massage at the end which was very relaxing and a perfect way to end our sublime stay :) We would highly recommend the Hyatt Regency Kyoto to others :)

    Excellent Hotel
    Extremely helpful and efficient staff, comfortable rooms, good restaurants, and a good location make this my ideal stay in Kyoto. I would happily stay here again. The hotel is beautiful and every part of it is comfortable. They also have a very good spa and I had a relaxing massage there.

    100 % recommended Location, Service, Comfort, cleanliness!!! This hotel has everything
    We were in love with this hotel, location, service, comfort, cleanliness, this hotel has everything. Location, it is right in the middle of everything. Taxis are affordable since everything is close by, it has two bus stops right in front of the hotel and it has a very good atmosphere. Service was impeccable. The person that greeds you was always there and making sure you get on and off of your rides, the front desks personal were attentive, friendly and supportive, the concierge were very helpful and gave us the recommendations that we were looking for. Clean and comfortable, the hotel, rooms and common areas were clean and organized at all times, the rooms were very comfortable, with space, modern and with a beautiful design. 100% recommended

    An amazing hotel in a great location
    The service in the hotel was perfect! All the staff were very friendly and happy to help with any questions or requests. Everyone was able to speak English very well, so it is a very welcoming place for tourists who don’t know very much Japanese. The room was clean and very spacious. The walled garden helped to cut down on the noise from the city, so I was always able to sleep really well. It is also perfectly located for visiting all the sights around Kyoto. It’s about 5 minutes’ walk away from the subway system, and there are bus stops just outside the entrance. All of the biggest sites are within around 30 minutes of public transportation, so you can visit a lot of places in a short amount of time. The on-site restaurants cater to many different tastes. Cafe 33 is the main dining area, which serves buffet breakfasts in the morning, and then an all-day menu featuring east-meets-west dishes like chicken kara age sandwiches, wagyu steak and chips and pork katsu curry. The 2nd floor features an Italian restaurant featuring various authentic pizzas and pastas. Finally, there is a Japanese restaurant on the basement floor. This serves high-end Japanese cuisine, with a lot of variety to choose from. With the opportunity to see a free Maiko (an apprentice Geisha) performance every Tues, Thurs & Sat, this hotel was a joy to stay in, and I cannot recommend it enough!

    Luxury hotel within walking distance of museums and temples
    We have never had more attentive bell services. Riho and her team absolutely went above and beyond. There was a problem with something we shipped and she took it to the shipping place so it would arrive on time. The kitchen staff was amazing! Every morning it was like watching a finely choreographed ballet. Chefs would visit us at our table, special requests were no problem. If we were a few minutes late they would let us order off the menu. The managers were incredibly friendly and always visible. The servers and bussers seemed to be enjoying themselves, laughing an having a great time. The food was unbelievable! I don’t like salad, but the chef made such a great salad I enjoyed it! The waffles were wonderful with strawberry sauce and maple syrup. They had a fresh squeezed juice offering that varied every day. We can’t wait to come back! There was also a Maiko performance that was beautifully staged. We are so glad we got to see it! We also wish to thank Sherpa, our server who memorized our breakfast order and was so welcoming she made us feel like family.

    Excellent Hotel
    We spent 7 nights at the Hyatt Regency Kyoto and loved it for its spacious, quiet and elegant room. and excellent service. The staff were professional, friendly and responsive to any request. The food was delicious at all the restaurants. We enjoyed the Italian restaurant, the afternoon tea and the cafe for lunch and the breakfast buffet. We often walked or took a taxi to Kyoto Station to explore different areas near Kyoto (Hiroshima, Himeiji, Arashimaya, Nara) and took the nearby subway to explore within Kyoto or the Hop On Hop Off Bus with a stop right next to the hotel.

    Restful & Relaxing Stay at The Hyatt Regency in Kyoto!
    Staff was very courteous and friendly. Almost always it was Service with a Smile. Amazing buffet breakfast! Italian restaurant was fantastic for a few dinners and the Hotel bar was a great spot to unwind after a day full of sight seeing.

    Excellent hospitality
    From the moment we exited the taxi we were greeted and provided the best customer service. The room and amenities were great. We rented two bikes from the hotel and spent the day exploring. Definitely recommend that as a mode of transportation for a different perspective of the city.

    My favorite Hyatt Regency in the world
    I love this Hyatt Regency! It’s the only hotel I/we stayed while in Kyoto for many many times! It’s in a quiet location next to the national museum and relatively close to the Kyoto Station. The hotel is beautifully designed. The rooms are small but clean and neat with comfortable beds. They offer great breakfast and all day dining. The staff is always helpful.

    Kyoto is so peaceful yet near lively shopping
    The room had the best hinoki bath salts! Plus the toilet opened and closed and warmed me and auto flushed!!! Super amazing! The beds were firm and the view was lovely. Only complaint my daughter had was sirens throughout the one night we were there. I fell asleep super early so heard nothing!

    Excellent location and reliable room
    The location of this hotel can not be surpassed and was in walking distance to many of the sightseeing highlights of Kyoto. The hotel itself was underwhelming in architecture and structure, but clean and comfortable. We also stayed at the Aman Kyoto, which was obviously a more elevated experienced, but the Hyatt rooms were clean, comfortable, and the breakfast was fantastic. The concierge is unreliable and only 1 person staffing the entire hotel.

    Excellent
    We enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again when visiting Tokyo. The hotel staff were very helpful, the room decor was lovely and the hotel dining was excellent. You may want to request a room on the third floor or above. The second floor rooms are below ground level and are a bit dark. There is bamboo planted outside of the windows which is nice though.

    Convenient well run hotel
    The hotel was very conveniently placed a 10 min taxi ride from the centre, station etc. Clean, comfortable and well run. We got caught out on the first night because the Japanese restaurant stopped serving at 8:30. We had our room upgraded so no complaints at all!

    Great area, Good size room and amenities, great food and desserts, enjoyed Maiko performance. Room carpets need cleaning. Did not get a chance to use the spa. Short walk to convenience store(s)-McDonalds. etc. Some worthwhile sites close to hotel to visit, Museum, temples, etc.

    Great Property
    I really enjoyed my stay here in January 2024. The staff are great, the breakfast is exceptional, the Maiko show was great to watch, the free taxi ride from the train station to the hotel is super nice, and the vibes at the Bar in the basement were great. Special shout out to the breakfast manager for helping our group with to-go iced coffees on our final day. Very kind! My only gripe is about their wifi and odd hotel setup. The wi-fi was incredibly slow and the front desk staff said they would have IT take a look at it the next day, but we were checking out the next day. The hotel is built weird so you have to take a few different elevators to get to the gym, but the gym itself was nice and well stocked.

    Great hotel and customer service
    Hotel was in a secluded area. Hotel was clean and presented well. Staff showed good customer service and greeted us each time we entered the lobby area. The Maiko performance was excellent. We had the Japanese breakfast one morning for 4,500 JPY. It had a lot of regional Japanese selections and completed well by the rest of the buffet. The king bed room was really spacious and allowed us to open our suitcases. The location is quiet but you need to walk or catch the local bus to get to attractions. Once you get used to the the bus, its really convenient as it takes you directly to Kyoto Station.

    Hyatt points not effective
    I’ve booked at the hotel reception my three nights, but I was made to pay two of those nights. The hotel argue that my reservation was made using cash instead of points, even though this was made with the assistance of Hyatt front desk personnel. At my check out Mr. Kazuto Terramoto- Room manager- was very rood and couldn’t care lees to try to resolve my situation. I’ve paid and left with a very disappointing feeling. Due to the massive tourists amounts the hotel is enjoying full occupancy, at the expense of not being able to deliver an average service. The hotel is already showing it’s age, it looks from a 90’s movie. Thanks

    drab hotel that's a bit out of the way
    At over $400 per night, I was disappointed. During check-in, the front desk staff were confused, they had trouble answering simple questions. my room as it turned out was on the lower level, strange since a restaurant and bar were also there. rooms were drab, sink was about a foot lower than standard sink (this wasn't an accessible room), bathroom tiles were apparently replaced with wrong sizes. And you have to step into this large tub for a shower, and the curtain doesn't really properly contain the water. Overall, just a bland place

    We were wry disappointed in the quality of the room. It was in need of renovation and the bed was the worst we’ve had. So close to the temple, staff was very kind. But I would not stay there again. Disappointed

    American hotel experience in Kyoto
    Avoid this property if you want a Japanese experience. This feels more like a Hyatt in New York or Atlanta than one in Kyoto. Be ready for the minimum. Rooms are basic. Breakfast is better than in the USA but not by much. Service is good but overall you can get a much better value at most hotels in Kyoto.

    Large spider in my room
    Woke up to find a LARGE spider on the wall next to my bed. I took a picture before I killed it. My son paid for the room but forgot to show the staff the spider. The room was clean otherwise, but this was very unsettling.
    October 2023Bob T
    There are better options in Kyoto
    Can't really suggest this hotel based on the cost per night for an upscale room vs. what you get for that cost. The hotel itself is older and the rooms could use a refresh and the room rate just seemed outrageous vs. what you get when compared to other hotels. The noise level was another surprise as the windows in the room seemed so thin, you hear all the road noise and even the 'gong' that goes off at 5am each day from the temple beside it. Also be prepared for unexpected charges as we had a 16,500 "service charge" per night as well as the 14,300 "room consumption tax" per night. Both the Service and food quality we experienced at the Italian restaurant was very poor. Dining for breakfast at the main Cafe was fine with good service and decent food. Overall there are better choices in Kyoto.

    Not a 5 star experience
    If you’re looking for a luxury hotel this isn’t it. I’d suggest a local Japanese hotel. The service was mid and so was the atmosphere. Breakfast was also underwhelming.

    Hyatt experience in Kyoto was disappointing
    I know it’s not Park Hyatt but for a Japanese hotel the carpet was stained and dirty. Only two bottle of water in an extremely hot week while we were staying in Kyoto. Breakfast staff was chaotic and toast did not come with an entree of eggs. They force you to the $5500 yen buffet option. The food was very average for what they charge.

    Dirty carpet in room, argue for decent room
    I was given want felt like a subterranean room adjacent to the restaurant so could hear constant clattering on the second floor. As an Amex Platinum card holder, was told no upgrade available until I insisted they try. When I asked if there was a pool, the direct responses was, “This is not a luxury hotel, if you wanted that go to the Park Hyatt.” The pluses: excellent breakfast, nice sheets. Stained carpet in room grossed me out.

    Gamble - personally never again
    Location is great, customer service is down, hotel is starting to look tired. We were booked for 6 nights and this was our 2nd stay (previous for 6 nights in 2023). This time around, 1st night we were allocated a dirty room/ stinky corridor (mould/ big water stain under AC unit, visible big stain on carpets, bubbly walls). We were moved for 1 night after wasting 1 hour complaining to reception. 2nd night, our personal belongings (travel bag) had been shoved into a cupboard onto of our luggage and shoes moved to accommodate another guests 6 pieces of luggage! Another wasted 1 hour, having to complain to management and request luggage to be moved. Very little Customer attention/ care throughout the hotel, bar one Albanian gentleman at reception. Attitude was "human error" - which we would accept if their luggage had simply been dumped in the room, but the staff had moved our travel bag from chair to a cupboard and placed it on top of our luggage, our shoes had been moved, our personal belongings were scattered throughout the room - clearly the room was occupied. Compensation offered 900 YEN taxi to station on last day (8 USD ha ha ha) - we weren't sure if they were joking or trying to insult. Email from manager was "sorry we didn't meet your high expectations" - sorry but since when wanting a clean room is high expectations!? Shame as we were in same hotel in 2023 for 6 nights, but seems the hotel is gone down. We are or I should say were loyal Hyatt members - it made no difference whatsoever. Location is great but that's about the only positive thing I can say. Unfortunately, we cannot load the video of the other guests belongings...

    OLD/Dated property. Do not recommend
    Very old, dated rooms. Bathrooms were horrible and needs upgrading badly. Grouts between tiles missing, mold growing, room furniture dated and damaged. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Staff very biased towards people of color. Staff needs training badly and property needs upgrade. Does not meet Hyatt standard at all. Location not great either.

    One of the best place you should not miss when you choose your stay in Kyoto
    Location is so good, quite, warm environment and near the train station. It is not far from the main shopping center, Kyoto station and easy access to many of tourist attractions. The staff are the great asset to the property, they are so helpful, polite and friendly. Hotel provides the free taxi to the hotel upon arrival near Kyoto station. The room is comfortable and clean. Breakfast option is various and our favourite is Japanese breakfast.

## Guest Reviews & Common Themes

**Overall Tone:**

- Majority of reviewers praise **excellent service**, polite and attentive staff, and the unique cultural touches (maiko performances, Japanese design in rooms, cypress bathtubs). Location near major historical sites but away from the busiest city crowds is another strong positive.

**Positives (Frequently Mentioned):**

1. **Staff & Service:**
   - Front desk, concierge, bell stand, and restaurant teams often singled out for exceptional hospitality.
   - Staff consistently assist with luggage, calling taxis, and arranging reservations.
2. **Location:**
   - Close to major temples (Sanjūsangendō is literally next door, Kiyomizu-dera about 20 minutes away, Gion about 15–20 minutes’ walk).
   - Near bus stops and a short taxi ride from Kyoto Station.
3. **Cultural Experiences:**
   - Maiko performances in the lobby.
   - Japanese-style elements in many rooms (tatami floors, lanterns, cypress tubs).
4. **Breakfast Quality:**
   - Wide variety, combining Japanese and Western fare. Several guests mention the French toast and waffle stations.

**Critiques (Less Frequent, but Notable):**

1. **Older Carpets / Slight Wear & Tear:**
   - A few guests mention stains or dated décor in certain rooms. Some corridor areas and rooms feel slightly worn.
2. **Value & Pricing:**
   - Kyoto can be expensive; some find the rates high vs. the age of the property or smaller room sizes compared to “5-star” expectations.
3. **Noise Issues:**
   - Some mention traffic or temple gong early in the morning, especially in rooms with street-facing windows.
   - Construction noise from the adjacent Red Cross demolition (daytime only).
4. **Room Layout Quirks:**
   - A handful of rooms are partially below ground (e.g., “2nd floor basement” near the restaurant), leading to less natural light.
   - Bathtubs can be deep or the shower layout a bit unusual for guests unfamiliar with Japanese bathrooms.

---

## Tips for a Better Stay

1. **Room Selection:**
   - If you value space, consider a deluxe or suite category (especially for families or longer stays).
   - Ask for higher-floor rooms or rooms facing the garden if quiet and natural light are top priorities.
   - If you plan to work or nap during the day, note the construction noise window (10 a.m.–5 p.m.).
2. **Getting Around Kyoto:**
   - Kyoto is known for its extensive bus network. Utilize the bus stop right outside or grab a one-day bus pass if you plan to sightsee extensively.
   - Taxis in Kyoto are metered, widely available, and typically accept credit cards.
3. **Local Customs & Culture:**
   - Be sure to explore the nearby temples early in the morning for a peaceful experience (some guests mention 6 a.m. services at local temples).
   - If you have the chance, attend one of the **Maiko performances**. They offer insight into Kyoto’s renowned Geisha traditions.

---

## Bottom Line

- The **Hyatt Regency Kyoto** blends modern Western-style hospitality with subtle Japanese design and cultural experiences. Guests consistently highlight the **superior service**, strong dining experiences, and a **serene location** tucked into Higashiyama—close enough to essential sites but removed from the full hustle of downtown.
- If you enjoy immersing yourself in **traditional Japanese aesthetics** while still wanting the comforts of a full-service international hotel chain, this property is an appealing choice.
- Minor critiques center on **carpet wear**, occasional noise, and typical Kyoto pricing, but most reviews find the hotel’s overall charm, staff dedication, and convenient location outweigh these drawbacks.

---

### Further Contextual Notes

- **Cultural Insight:** Traditional cypress bathtubs (made of “hinoki” wood) are deeply associated with relaxation in Japanese culture, often linked to onsen or ryokan experiences. The cypress aroma is said to have calming effects and is quite a treat if you’ve never experienced it before.
- **Maiko vs. Geiko/Geisha:** A Maiko is an apprentice Geisha, typically distinguished by certain styles of kimono and hairstyle. Being able to view a live Maiko performance in a hotel setting (with complimentary seating) is somewhat rare and is a wonderful way to glimpse Kyoto’s performing arts heritage.
- **Navigating Kyoto’s Temples:** If temple-hopping is on your agenda, try to start early or visit near sunset to avoid crowds. Some temples offer early morning prayers or late entry for quieter visits.

---

**I hope this breakdown helps you appreciate the Hyatt Regency Kyoto’s unique offerings and better positions you to decide if this style of accommodation resonates with your interests in Japanese culture, comfort, and hospitality.**

Stayed one night
It was worth seeing and it was a space, but unfortunately the customer service was not good.I don't think it would be nice if I didn't get a call before check-in.

It was warmer and better than I thought. There was a little noise when I opened and closed the bathroom door, but overall it was okay.

Beautiful townhouse with modern interiors and great amenities. Check in and check out were simple, and access to the property was easy with no key required. Bedroom and Japanese room are on the second floor, with bathroom and kitchen on the ground floor. A steep staircase connects the two, which made bringing our suitcases upstairs a little challenging. Approx 7 min walk to the bus stop and closest mart.
Overall a great stay!

Stayed a few nights
This place was the highlight of our trip to Kyoto! The area is beautiful with lots to do however, going back to the house after a long day to take a relaxing bath was one of the best parts of our trip. The house looks exactly like the images and was very clean. I reccomend this place for anyone staying in Kyoto!!

Based on the listing details and guest feedback, **Sabino House** (さびの家) in Kyoto appears to be a **very good choice** overall. Here are the main points to consider:

1. **High Guest Rating**
   - Average of **4.7 out of 5 stars** from 47 reviews.
   - 81% of reviewers gave it 5 stars.
   - Guests frequently praise the **cleanliness**, modern interior, and overall comfort.

2. **Entire Townhouse Rental**
   - You get a **private, two-story machiya-style** townhouse (\~61 m²).
   - **Steep staircase** to the second floor (where the bedroom and tatami room are) could be challenging if you have heavy luggage or mobility concerns.
   - **Check-in** is self-service (smart lock) but the host provides a walkthrough for new arrivals.

3. **Sleeping Arrangements**
   - A **king-size bed** on the second floor for 1–2 guests.
   - For groups of 3 or more, **futons** can be set up in the tatami room (extra fee of ¥2,200 per futon if needed beyond the number of registered guests).

4. **Location**
   - Situated in **Shimogyo Ward**, close to local shops and bus routes (about a 7-minute walk to the nearest bus stop).
   - Overall location rating is **4.6/5**, so not the absolute city center but still convenient for exploring Kyoto (e.g., Gion or Kyoto Station by short bus or taxi ride).

5. **Optional Meals**
   - Breakfast (¥3,900 per person) and dinner (¥6,800 per person) can be arranged if booked **at least 3 days** prior.
   - Many guests enjoy the availability of a **traditional Japanese meal** at the property.

6. **Overall Experience**
   - Guests mention it feels like an authentic yet modernized Japanese townhouse.
   - The host, Sabino, is a **Superhost** with a **high response rate** and consistent cleanliness standards.

### Potential Downsides

- **Communication issues** were noted by a small percentage of reviewers (e.g., one guest felt the pre-check-in process lacked enough contact).
- The **bathroom door** can be somewhat noisy, and the **stairs** can be steep (mentioned in a few reviews).
- Location is slightly off the main tourist track, but most guests still found it convenient.

---

### Bottom Line

If you’re looking for a **private, modern-meets-traditional machiya experience** in Kyoto—with a spacious king bed, self-contained amenities, and the option for in-house Japanese meals—Sabino House seems like a solid pick. It’s best suited for **couples or small groups** who don’t mind stairs and want a **quiet, authentic** stay with many comforts of home. Overall, reviews strongly recommend it for a memorable Kyoto visit.

**Short Answer:** Yes. This townhouse is in **Shimogyo Ward**, a centrally located area of Kyoto close to many conveniences and major transport lines, making it a good base for exploring the city.

---

## Location Overview

1. **Central Ward of Kyoto**
   - Shimogyo Ward encompasses Kyoto Station and much of the downtown area. While it may not be right next to Gion or Nishiki Market, it’s still considered *fairly central* within the city.

2. **Proximity to Public Transit**
   - The listing notes it’s about a **7-minute walk** to the nearest bus stop. From there, buses in Kyoto can take you to major tourist areas (Gion, Kiyomizu-dera, etc.) fairly quickly—often in under 15 minutes, depending on traffic.
   - Kyoto Station (the main transport hub) is also located in Shimogyo Ward, typically accessible via a short bus/taxi ride or a moderate walk, depending on the exact address.

3. **Neighborhood Convenience**
   - Reviewers mention a convenience store (“mart”) about 7 minutes away on foot.
   - Most guests rate the location **4.6 out of 5**, which suggests it strikes a balance between being near the attractions yet offering a calmer residential environment away from the densest tourist crowds.

4. **Attractions Nearby**
   - You’ll find plenty of shops, cafés, and local eateries throughout Shimogyo and neighboring wards like Nakagyo (where Shijo-Karasuma and Nishiki Market are located).
   - Kyoto’s main bus routes connect you to must-see temples (e.g., Kiyomizu-dera, Gion, Arashiyama) without too much hassle.

---

## Who Might Prefer This Location

- **Travelers Wanting Some Quiet:** It’s central but not right on a bustling tourist street, so you’ll have a more local, less crowded atmosphere.
- **Those Comfortable with Buses/Short Walks:** Kyoto’s bus network is extensive. If you don’t mind a short walk to the stop (or a quick taxi), getting around the city is straightforward.
- **People Interested in a Traditional Feel with Urban Access:** You get an authentic machiya-style townhouse within reach of city amenities.

---

## Possible Drawbacks

- **Not Immediately Beside Top Tourist Spots:** You may need to rely on **bus or taxi** for Gion, Fushimi Inari, and other popular sites. (For some, that’s part of the charm.)
- **Steep Staircase Inside:** If you plan on carrying big luggage or have mobility concerns, note the townhouse has two floors connected by a somewhat steep staircase.

---

## Bottom Line

For most visitors, **Sabino House** in Shimogyo Ward is indeed a good, **centrally located** spot within Kyoto. It’s easy enough to reach the city’s main attractions by a short bus or taxi ride, and the walkability rating from past guests is quite positive. If you value having a quieter retreat rather than being on a busy main street, this location offers the best of both worlds.
