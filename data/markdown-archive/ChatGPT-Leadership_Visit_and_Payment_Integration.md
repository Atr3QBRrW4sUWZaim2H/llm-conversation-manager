Speaker 1 | 00:39
That's cool. Ashwin he pale.

Speaker 1 | 01:03
My God, is it the snow?
Speaker 4 | 01:07
I think it was the flu, but other than that, I'm much better.
Speaker 1 | 01:11
Just this. Yeah, I'm actually.
Speaker 4 | 01:13
Yeah, the. I don't know if you knew that as a part of the leadership visit. So I'm off camera because of. I'm still in my hotel room and I will need to drop up five minutes early to take the SL to.
Speaker 1 | 01:27
No worries. Sorry, whereabouts are you? I didn't quite hear that.
Speaker 4 | 01:32
I'm India in herabad hede leadership visit.
Speaker 1 | 01:37
Right that's pretty cool that's awesome.
Speaker 4 | 01:41
I was yeah it's been so much fun.
Speaker 1 | 01:44
That's I can only imagine I don't know Vikram and others are there correct.
Speaker 4 | 01:49
Riser Chicosia yeah a lot of people a lot of wow.
Speaker 1 | 01:56
Okay nice Hydrobad are you guys in Hydrobad.
Speaker 4 | 01:59
We're in Hydrobad. Yeah.
Speaker 1 | 02:01
Okay, yeah, Hydrobad is like where my family is, my MoM and mothers. Yeah, maybe next time I should do a visit there. Wow.
Speaker 4 | 02:12
Yeah, and the office here is pretty amazing too.
Speaker 1 | 02:15
Really? Okay, where exactly is the office located? Gutchiblichib live closed. It'll be good for you. I need to. I used to talk to Abishik about it and for sourcing and you know, we planned at some point that I'll make a trip and all of that stuff, but then at that point, like the reward happened and we kind of dropped that. 
Yeah, I'm off video as well, guys, because I'm in the car drop driving kids the other duty that you all that we all have and when we are not working and I guess.
ME | 03:05
Are we waiting on. Someone else from the payment team?
Speaker 1 | 03:08
Yes.
ME | 03:10
Okay. We just will wait a little bit.
Speaker 1 | 03:11
Yeah. I think we're waiting for unct. Is that correct? BL I believe I was yeah, that's right.
ME | 03:19
Yeah, he accepted. And Kim accepted. So I guess we'll wait for them.
Speaker 1 | 03:27
Yeah I think uncle just said he's running a few minutes late.
ME | 03:31
Okay, great.
Speaker 4 | 03:31
I don't know. Ashwin AZ if you are in front of your laptop, can you? Ping Kim yeah sure.
Speaker 3 | 03:40
I can pink him accept I'm think yeah let me just pick a quick.
Speaker 4 | 03:45
Nine m her dim I think she accepted that she should be yeah.
Speaker 3 | 03:50
Accepted that I can find out to see whether she's able to join.
Speaker 1 | 04:17
While the other folks join. I don't know if you need to wait or do you all did you all meet each other? Do we need any intros?
Speaker 4 | 04:26
I actually have not met. I don't think I have METAA as okay, I can I'm part of the financial systems product team, Financial systems and HR systems product team. So a big part of what we do is monetization, setting up new products, new skes for monetizing. 
I think that's probably the context for this.
Speaker 1 | 04:52
Meaning.
ME | 04:56
Cool. I'm actually I'm a product manager on the premium side. Yeah, we just made our first couple of dollars of revenue. And so we want to understand like how to make that a first class citizen. Revenue from job seekers inside of Indeed that kind of thing. 
And we have, I guess career services that needs to be brought along. But for this conversation, I think it's how do we figure out, getting the revenue from Apple and accounting for it properly and then the future for Google pay and, somewhere on web as well.
Speaker 4 | 05:37
Nice to meet you.
ME | 05:38
Nice to meet you.
Speaker 3 | 05:40
Hey, I'm Riaz. I'm with the PMMO team, so I'm helping Deeply and Ashwin on the project program management side of things. So yeah, I just started with the team like maybe four, four months ago, maybe. 
So yeah, I'm just kind of new to the theme. But yeah, I'm. I've been working with them closely on a lot of stuff that's programmed in it. So nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you.
Speaker 4 | 06:02
Yeah, I think you and I have exchanged some slacks. I don't know what [Laughter] really.
Speaker 3 | 06:08
Yeah, that drinks a bell. My god, you're right, [Laughter] nice to finally meet you. We actually talked to you over the phone that that's correct.
Speaker 1 | 06:17
That's right Riaz or somebody do you mind sharing the zoom link with Unki? He's asking and I'm driving. Sure. I don't know why it's in the invite. So I'm not sure why it's missing. If you don't mind, I'll sell it to him.
Speaker 4 | 06:35
And why don't you Slack it to him and I will. What's happened to him?
Speaker 3 | 06:41
Okay.
Speaker 1 | 06:42
Thanks, Perl. And Perl, as you know, I was on sourcing and I moved to the job seeker. And one of the areas I think we talked about this a few months ago, it's a zero to one product. What Ashwin was talking about the job seeker premium. 
I know there is an employer. We are talking about job seeker premium here. It's a zero to one product. We got a go ahead from Chris to test premium or a paid offering in Canada and non US markets at this point. 
So we are we actually ramp are ramping in Canada right now we are at 1% and we should be getting it up, tiling it up to, you know, a higher number later this week. We are on iOS but you know, for India specifically, which is kind of like our next milestone, we want to we need to support Android payments. 
So that's one part of the conversation. I think when UNC joins, I think he's on the call as well. So that's one part of the thing. The other thing is as we want to start scaling up beyond what we are right now because we are in kind of mod, we want to make sure like, you know, we work, engage your team and figure out the right payments right? 
And then this is where like Kim and other parties come into play like procurement, how to work with procurement, legal and so on. Ashwin has been kind of playing that role. But I think we need your support and your team's help because we are not experts in that. 
And you guys already have the relationships across all the other stakeholders and you already know how to do all of this stuff. So I think that's where like, you know, we want to kind of start establishing that working model as well.
Speaker 4 | 08:29
Yeah. Yeah. So for the so I remember, like from a discussion months ago that for the pilot. And we had used like Apple pay as a solution, right? Yeah, and then this expand beyond. Okay, so there are two things you mentioned deeply is it that to expand beyond the pilot we need to like now do pers differently.
Speaker 1 | 08:55
So one is Android would be the number one priority and Ashwin correct me. Otherwise Android would be the number one priority. How do we support that from a prement collection perspective? Two would be. Yes, we would need to have some level of checkpoint with like Chris of expanding this further parting that conversation. Yes. The second part is like how do we scale up and support non iOS platforms and, you know, support the scale overall.
Speaker 4 | 09:27
Okay, so basically right now it's like as a beta product, which has fewer checks and balances, but now that if we want to expand, it has to go through accounting and legal and all of that stuff. Yeah, we were killed.
Speaker 1 | 09:40
Yeah, we have done a lot of that, to be honest, and I think it was kind of a scramble. But I think we need to put those processes in place and get ahead of, you know, kind of this reactive mode. So that's where. 
Like. And I think you guys know this. You've done this. And we want to start engaging your team.
Speaker 4 | 09:59
Sure. Okay, yeah, I think that's where Kim can help with the process. Why don't we focus and I hope she can join. But why don't we start with the Android discussion, since that's your top priority?
Speaker 1 | 10:10
Yeah, and before I say anything, Ashwin, is that right? Is that the right setup? So that's why I want to make sure, like, Ashwin is gonna be okay.
ME | 10:15
Yeah. I agree with that. Priority? Yes.
Speaker 1 | 10:19
Cool. And I think Unket joined. I don't know if you need any intros here at hi.
Speaker 5 | 10:26
Sorry I joined a bit late, I was struggling with my internet connection.
Speaker 1 | 10:30
No worries.
Speaker 4 | 10:34
So I don't know how much of the context you got that DP was talking about, which is after the pilot in Canada expanding to India where they would need support for Android payments because India is mostly an Android market.
Speaker 5 | 10:49
I see. Yeah. So I think when it comes to Android. So I know we were testing this with Apple pay. And then when I got into the details of how things work with Thele, if you're trying to use a third party system, which in our case is going to be il the experience is not ideal. The experience is pretty broken for a customer who's trying to make a purchase on a merchant side. B be it Indeed be it booking.com, be it any merchant. 
But if it is Android, then I think, we are in a better place when it comes to experience. How is it going to work? Like how things will work using the existing payments platform is something that we'll have to figure out which we can do with the team.
ME | 11:44
So k are you saying that on Android're recommending we use ad end rather than Google pay.
Speaker 5 | 11:56
I would say so. And the reason why I'm suggesting that is no, unless and until you are still piloting. Like unless and until you have not made the decision to scale. I would say using the existing platform so that we don't end up building multiple platforms, duplicating efforts, complicating processes, which includes accounting and, you know, many downstream systems. I would say just reuse what already exist.
ME | 12:31
Is okay, I hear you. So should we explore this idea more in this meeting or should we keep the meeting a little bit more? How high level and how we can work together. 
I think on Kit and I could probably take this offline or we could discuss it here.
Speaker 5 | 12:43
Yeah, I think we can correct. I think we can keep it high level. I think it's good to understand your priorities, your decision criteria to scale up.
ME | 12:48
Okay, from our point of view, I we would we our approach would be the same at least until this conversation would be the same that we did with Apple, which is to rely on the least the most seamless payment method offered on the platform so that we could get the most conversions. 
And that could be that we could offer an in a web view and that could be great or we have to use Google pay. But I hear what you're saying. So I think I need to do more technical investigation on we can use that yet or not yet.
Speaker 1 | 13:27
Yeah, just a quick question.
ME | 13:29
I hear you.
Speaker 1 | 13:32
If we use AAN, can we actually even do web payments or is that only for Android?
ME | 13:38
Yeah, we would use an for web as well. We like we would use Adion for Web.
Speaker 1 | 13:41
Okay, got it.
ME | 13:41
And now were saying, could we use it for Android?
Speaker 1 | 13:45
And is that something. Ashwin can we do that for Canada? Like if let's say we want more users, right?
ME | 13:50
Yeah, we could. Yeah, but there's nobody on web like Android is the other big audience in at least.
Speaker 1 | 13:54
Okay, that that's good to know because I think one of the things is we are kind of limited by the audience space that we have on iOS right now. And if you want to. I see. So it doesn't make sense.
ME | 14:10
Yeah, right, exactly.
Speaker 1 | 14:11
So if at all we would first expand on right.
ME | 14:13
Like, yeah, web we just get like later it's a pretty long tail.
Speaker 1 | 14:14
So it got it. Yeah. From my perspective, I think maybe there can be follow up on the details. I'm interested to understand experience wise, would adding going via ADD and would that add more friction to the job seekers? 
And then how quickly can we do this? Integration?
ME | 14:35
Yeah, we need to do an investigation.
Speaker 5 | 14:36
Yes. So I think we'll have to investigate that. So I'm pretty sure, like when it comes to web, it works because that's exactly how our employers are, paying, you know, for what more?
ME | 14:48
That's how career services works. So we have an example on the job seeker side as well. We're using career services in an.
Speaker 5 | 14:57
Yes.
ME | 15:01
So, yeah, we can follow up later on Kit and I with a kind of. Here's two path here's some options document. 
So like, once we have the money. I guess if we go through a, then we get a lot of it for free. If we cannot go through an then it gets a little more into the Apple territory where we'll have a new vendor and a new process and like of a new revenue process. 
And that's where Kim's team comes in, I think. Is that correct?
Speaker 5 | 15:42
I think that's something that Kim can confirm. Ashwin. But yeah, when it comes to Apple pay, I don't think we should be using the existing platform because the experience is completely broken. 
And that's pretty intentional from Apple. They don't want, the third party payments to get processed on Apple. So, I'm not sure if Kim is the best person to support that, but maybe Kim can confirm.
ME | 16:10
Okay. I can follow up with her. Thank you.
Speaker 3 | 16:14
And Kit, you were saying before it's currently used by employers to make payments, is that correct? LI.
Speaker 5 | 16:21
Yeah. So when it comes to employers globally, it's the payments. And now you know, the billing platform is being used by all employers globally to make payments, so that set up that infrastructure. All the processes are already in place for employers globally. Got.
Speaker 3 | 16:47
It. And that's web ban mobile both right? I guess I can sorry.
Speaker 5 | 16:51
Say that again.
Speaker 3 | 16:52
That's web band mobile both or just for what?
Speaker 5 | 16:56
So it's on web. We support Android. How the experience looks like on Android is something that I still need to figure out, and that's something that we can follow up with you and Ashwin later. But other than Apple, I think all platforms are supported.
Speaker 3 | 17:17
Got it that' that's very helpful. Thank you Kit.
Speaker 4 | 17:21
I know we have advertiser IDS only for employers and not seekers. Does that become a BAL?
Speaker 5 | 17:31
Yeah. So remember, part we were talking about is that, you know, we have to kind of make our platform work for both job seekers as well as employers because we know that job seekers premium subscription is something that Indeed wants to invest in. 
So we will have to kind of make that change on our platform to make it work. But once we make that change, we will be able to start processing payments for subscriptions as well as, you know, courier services, which right now is directly integrated with that.
Speaker 4 | 18:08
Yes. So that was my question specifically. I know we need to do it. At what point does it become important? So I know we were able to do a job seeker premium without enabling that. So this next phase that we are talking about enabling it with Android via an that point, does that become a dependency or no.
Speaker 5 | 18:28
Yeah, yes, it will become a dependency. And that's exactly what I want to understand. Maybe in this call is that. What are your plans to scale what's the decision criteria that you know the Ashwin Rayas are looking at to go beyond Apple and where what is that time line looking like because. Then accordingly, we can figure out what needs to be done on our side and how feasible it's going to be for us to know meet that kind of timeline.
Speaker 4 | 19:06
Yeah, it would be good to get that understanding deep. The.
Speaker 1 | 19:10
Yeah. So let me maybe voice over how we are thinking about it. And Ashwin RIA is still free to jump in. So from our perspective, like I said, we just ramped it in Canada. We don't have the product market faed yet. We need to first prove that. 
So our goal at least in the next two to three months is to do like some funnel level optimizations and so on so we get to a certain level of conversions and retention. I expect that to take anywhere like maybe two months of iterations or so. Which will give us a good indication in terms of are we trending in the right direction or not around that point is when I think we want to maybe in two plus months out is when maybe we want to be ready to start testing this in India market as well. Now there is some capacity bandwidth planning that we are kind of going through right now, but assuming that we have the capacity on the team to support that, I would say roughly about in about two months ish we want to get something out in India in terms of like scaling up. 
I think it all depends on the product market fit, right? If we feel like, hey, there is a product market fit, we are seeing enough conversions and so on, then I think there's nothing that's stopping us from scaling up. We kind of have the green light from Kris. We may just need to bring it back to his attention to make sure, like, before we do any scale up kind of work, he's fully on board.
Speaker 5 | 20:45
And just to confirm, you said right now it's only in Canada, correct?
Speaker 1 | 20:50
That is correct.
Speaker 5 | 20:52
Okay. And any early signs, early results that you can share.
Speaker 1 | 20:59
We are counting two digit numbers here. Our early two digit numbers here, like one digit number. In terms of the paid subscribers, it's only ramped like maybe ten days now. My fee. Okay, yeah, and if we have a free trial experience. 
So we're just crossing the seven day free trial mark, and we have three pay paying subscribers at this point, so. So very early days.
Speaker 5 | 21:25
Got it?
ME | 21:25
So in another forum where we talked about this for how do we accept payments from Apple it with Kim and her team, we had some we had we made some agreement there that everything below ten KA month.
Speaker 5 | 21:25
Got it. Got it.
ME | 21:40
As long like that's the level at which we need to trigger the next level of whatever that accounting whatever the next level of accounting investment is for job seeker accounting. 
So I wonder. Like, is it is like. Is that the same here? Like can we is there a way where we can run the like what DD is saying find product market fit and find the early, you know, figure out to get the fundamentals right on the product and then run it to 10k and say, okay, we're going to stop or we can invest more. 
Like can we just establish some level there? 
I guess neither nobody knows.
Speaker 1 | 22:24
Sorry, who is the question?
ME | 22:26
I guess the question, I guess to unkit their parole is or maybe it's to no one on this call is can we like Paro asked like when does it become urgent? And I'm wondering, like we established another thread that it becomes urgent when we start like a ten KA month in iOS for the iOS SS stream, is that the same rule we can apply here for Android?
Speaker 1 | 22:49
Got it. You're saying specifically for if you want a job seeker advertiser ID kind of a model.
ME | 22:55
Yeah, exactly. Like, do we need to do anything before ten K or can we just do the thing and then see where we're getting and then say, okay, now we need to invest more in the advertiser ID stuff?
Speaker 1 | 22:57
Okay.
Speaker 5 | 23:06
Yeah, I think we would need to do that. Ashwin. Because, if we are investing in. In, you know, that advertiser I work. Then it should be like we should be pretty confident that that's the right investment that we are making. 
And that's something that's going to be needed to process, you know, these subscription payments for job seekers.
ME | 23:30
I see, because it's the core system.
Speaker 5 | 23:31
So yeah.
ME | 23:32
Okay, yes, I understand.
Speaker 5 | 23:35
And that's why I wanted to kind of understand what are early results looking like because you know, we if we have to kind of put it on our road map, we have to be very confident that this is the right investment that, you know, we are making.
ME | 23:49
I hear what you're saying. We don't. I mean. We have.
Speaker 1 | 23:52
A huge is that a huge lift on it from your perspective getting the job?
Speaker 5 | 23:58
I'm not too sure. Deep. I think it's we should definitely do that. It's right for you know, it's a long term thing that we should definitely invest in whether it's whether that investment should be done now or later is something that, you know, we need to understand. How big is the lift? 
I think I'll have to depend on my team to kind of provide me that information. I think there's gonna be another team that's gonna get involved here. Cam team, so we'll have to work with them as well. 
But I think we have been having those discussions with that team, and we all kind of agree that we need to move towards this model sooner or later. So any guidance inputs that you can provide as. And you and Ashwin can provide on you know how the results are trending. As soon as you have them, you'll be able to figure out how soon should we put this particular effort on our road map.
ME | 25:00
So I.
Speaker 1 | 25:00
Okay. And maybe if you can just help us understand the lift, right? Like how big? Or is it a small medium, extra large? Like, what's the scope that we're talking about? I think that'll give me some idea in terms of how soon how prepared do we need to be about this? 
And then to Ashman's earlier question on hey, can we get a pass until a certain until we hit a certain threshold? I mean, why? I actually think that's a great question. And you know, we already do that with career services today. 
So what is why is that a nonstarter from your perspective? I'm just trying to understand.
Speaker 5 | 25:35
So it's not a nonstarter. I think today Courier Services is already integrated with Adion. So the point is that, should we think about payments and billing platform or should we just on. Because I think the revenue there is extremely small, right? 
So, I mean, I wanted to move it right.
Speaker 1 | 26:06
I guess initially before we hit like the scale for the product market fit, I would expect it to still be small even through the job seeker premium India, right? So I guess to Ashwan's point. And maybe we could if we could just start with whatever Career Services does today on the ABLE platform and then, you know, be ready to do it the right way with the job seeker I advertiser I whatever. 
However you're framing, that feels like the right approach. So that way we are this is not a big dependency.
Speaker 5 | 26:45
I think yeah, that that's definitely one approach that kind of eliminates the dependency on you know, on fences theme. And you can kind of. 
Eventually they should off of the existing platform because otherwise we are just duplicating not just the platform but the processes as well, which is you know, which is not good. 
That's my only recommendation.
Speaker 1 | 27:23
Got it. And that. That makes sense. That makes sense.
Speaker 1 | 27:26
Thank you.
ME | 27:27
The from the product development point of view, like we are going to have results in Canada, but we all know that same product is not going to be performing performed the same way in India. 
So I think we're at a point where we are going to need to either give the product away for free but more probably charge job seekers like we need to charge job seekers to understand if it's valuable and to iterate on its value. 
And so I guess it's kind of like it is like a chicken and an egg where we kind of need to collect money from job seekers in order to know what to build for them. So I agree like a perfect world we could know like here's what we have in Canada and here's how it'll perform in India. 
But I don't think we'll have that certainty. And so I do think it'll be more of a strategic decision based on like what's the level of effort and like how confident are we that we want to go to India rather than something that's like we have we think that the Candada results are going to translate. I just want to point that out like we do need to test.
Speaker 1 | 28:33
Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1 | 28:35
That. That's correct.
Speaker 1 | 28:36
And I think it's more about sequencing and the bandwidth at this point from our team's perspective. I think, you know, obviously the immediate focus is around the Canada iterations before we get to the Android based on our prioritization. 
But hopefully we can carve out a team and get there, do some parallel work and get there in two months from now.
ME | 29:04
Alright. So I think the next step is for me to work with the team, the technical team to understand what are our options technically for collecting payments and then work with on Kit to figure out, you know, further whittle down what can we do for Indeed and when and what makes sense. Does that sound right?
Speaker 1 | 29:30
Yeah, I think that makes sense. And the other part is we still didn't get to that point. Like I because we're missing him on the call. But UNKT I think is there somebody who can be the primary POC? I don't know from your team or how that would work between your team, our team and Kim's team. 
So Ashwin is not playing that role, which, I don't know, like coordinating with like legal procurement and all of that. I don't know if you guys have a model where you have a primary POC dealing with all of that.
Speaker 5 | 30:10
Yeah, so I think Mark Guinea should be the person who you should work with.
Speaker 1 | 30:20
Yeah, I believe Ashwin.
Speaker 1 | 30:21
You were right.
Speaker 3 | 30:23
Yeah, we did the alchy is one we treasury you're working with.
ME | 30:27
Yeah, he's in the loop already.
Speaker 3 | 30:27
Yes.
ME | 30:29
Yeah, he's one of the people on the in the loop.
Speaker 3 | 30:30
No. Yes. I have to drop for another call and a quick question. ATH Ashwin do you know report bus? AAN do is it robust like Apple reporting? 
I mean on the back end?
ME | 30:43
Y yeah. An is the same. And I think Indeed built Indeed basically built its own employment platform on top of AAN so we have our own in house reporting as well. 
Okay. So I'll follow up with Mark as well for getting some coordination going then.
Speaker 1 | 31:03
Okay. 
Yeah, let's chat about that separately. Ashwin I think we'll need to figure out what the right operating model here is but looks like on the Android front. Like you and at will do the follow up. We'll get the, kind of like the sizing. What is the effort and, sounds like we don't have the job seeker idea as a blocker. At least till we get to a certain threshold. 
So we should be good on that front. But at some point, I think unit you need to get this into your backlog or prioritization. So based on maybe the effort sizing and then the timelines that we are thinking of, we can come back and maybe put some, you know, some rough road mapping there. 
Does that make sense?
ME | 32:11
Makes sense to me.
Speaker 3 | 32:17

Below is a **condensed, topic-by-topic summary** of the conversation. I’ve highlighted key points and terminology around **product-market fit, payment integrations, and zero-to-one product development** that you might find interesting or useful as you ramp up your understanding of how teams coordinate new paid offerings.

---

## 1. General Context and Intros

- **Speaker 1** and **Speaker 4** note they haven’t spoken for a while and catch up briefly. Speaker 4 mentions they are in Hyderabad for a leadership visit.
- **Speaker 1** shares they are on the move (e.g., driving kids) and is off-camera.
- **ME (You)**: Introduces themselves as a Product Manager on the Job Seeker premium side. Explains that the team has just started making small amounts of revenue from a new paid offering (“job seeker premium”).

**Key takeaway**: This is a new, experimental product (a “zero-to-one” product) that Indeed is rolling out carefully to assess user demand, refine the experience, and prove product-market fit.

---

## 2. Purpose of the Meeting

- The group is looking to **expand payment methods** beyond Apple (iOS) for job seekers. Currently, the product is in **Canada** on iOS with Apple Pay.
- Next major target market: **India**, where most of the audience is on **Android**. The big question is how to **enable payments** there—whether via **Google Play’s in-app purchases** or via an **existing Indeed payment platform** (referred to as “Adyen” or the “billing platform”).

**Key takeaway**: The product team needs to figure out how to incorporate multiple payment solutions (Apple Pay, Google Pay, or direct credit card processing via the existing Indeed employer platform) without creating friction for users or duplicating efforts behind the scenes.

---

## 3. Current State of Revenue / Product-Market Fit

- The **Canada pilot** is extremely early. They just turned on a **7-day free trial**, and only a handful of paid subscribers have converted.
- The team wants to refine the funnel, improve retention, and gather proof that the product will truly resonate with job seekers (i.e., prove **product-market fit**).

**Key takeaway**: The conversation reinforced that they need time to iterate on the funnel and collect data before heavily investing in large-scale infrastructure changes.

---

## 4. Scaling to India & Android

- **Speaker 1** and **ME** clarify that India is the next major test market but it is almost exclusively Android.
- **Speaker 5** (the Indeed billing/payments subject-matter expert) explains the difference in user experience for third-party payment systems on iOS vs. Android.
  - **On iOS**: Apple enforces tight restrictions, so using Apple’s in-app payment is typically the path.
  - **On Android**: There is more flexibility, but using Adyen (Indeed’s existing payment platform) might be the most straightforward approach.
  - The conversation weighs if they should just “reuse what’s already built” (i.e., Adyen/billing platform) instead of creating a new integration with Google Play Billing.

**Key takeaway**: Reusing Indeed’s existing Adyen platform could be simpler and more maintainable in the long run, but the product team will explore the **technical friction** vs. the **conversion benefits** of each solution.

---

## 5. Advertiser IDs and Accounting Requirements

- **Speaker 4** and **Speaker 5** talk about how the current Indeed billing platform is set up primarily for **employers**. They use “advertiser IDs” to track charges. This system would need modifications to handle **job seeker billing** properly.
- There is a mention of a **revenue threshold** (e.g., “10k per month”) that triggers deeper accounting, legal, and compliance requirements.
- The plan is to figure out if they can keep using the existing minimal approach (like with Career Services) until the revenue or usage grows enough to justify building the full “job seeker advertiser” tracking model.

**Key takeaway**: They are balancing **minimal viable compliance** (for small pilot revenue) with the eventual move to a robust, scalable solution for job seeker billing that can handle large volumes.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Technical Investigation**: The product team (ME & engineers) will investigate how to integrate Android payments—whether via Google’s native in-app system or the existing Adyen-based flow used for employers.
2. **Assess Effort & Feasibility**: Speaker 5 (billing SME) will sync with their team to determine the level of effort in updating the billing platform for job seekers.
3. **Coordination**:
   - **Kim’s team** will be engaged again for legal, procurement, and accounting processes.
   - **Mark G** (from treasury/billing) is also a key point of contact.

**Key takeaway**: Everyone agreed that final decisions hinge on how quickly the pilot can show **viable metrics** (e.g., conversions, user retention) and at what point it makes sense to invest more heavily in the backend payments infrastructure.

---

## 7. Broader Themes & Concepts

1. **Zero-to-One Product Development**:
   - Rolling out a new paid product in small test markets (Canada on iOS) to validate core hypotheses before going all-in on infrastructure.

2. **Product-Market Fit**:
   - Gauging early subscription traction is critical. Without enough paying customers, it’s risky to invest heavily in the underlying systems.

3. **Payment Platforms & User Experience**:
   - **Apple Pay** can be seamless but has policy constraints.
   - **Google Play** for Android may simplify user experience but has different constraints and fees.
   - **Adyen** is an enterprise payment platform Indeed already uses for employers, potentially saving time and complexity if adapted for job seekers.

4. **Revenue & Compliance Thresholds**:
   - Until subscription revenue crosses a certain threshold (like 10k/month), simpler or more experimental approaches might be enough.
   - Once the business scales, a full-blown compliance solution with job seeker IDs, advanced reporting, and integrated accounting becomes mandatory.

---

## Final Observations

- The conversation focuses on **balancing speed-to-market** (get real user signals on whether a paid subscription is valuable) with **long-term scalability** (ensuring the payment system can handle large volumes and comply with financial regulations).
- Everyone’s aligned that the next test market after Canada is likely **India** (Android) because of its massive job-seeker population.
- Ultimately, the plan involves:
  1. Proving subscription demand.
  2. Determining the simplest integration path (Adyen vs. direct Google in-app).
  3. Monitoring revenue growth and ramping up compliance processes when it surpasses threshold levels.

This conversation is a classic example of **iterative product development**:

1. Pilot with minimal features.
2. Collect data.
3. Decide whether to invest in a robust, scalable system.
4. Expand to additional geographies and platforms.

---

### How This Might Link to Your Interests

- If you’re exploring **monetization** and **payment flows** for a new product, you’ll often start with a small pilot (e.g., Canada iOS) to measure viability.
- When considering expansions (like to **emerging markets** such as India), the choice of payment platform is critical to optimize user experience and reduce churn at checkout.
- **Compliance** (accounting, tax rules, vendor management) becomes crucial once the product hits a certain revenue scale, adding complexity to the product roadmap.

By following these steps—pilot, measure, pivot (or scale)—you can minimize heavy engineering or compliance investments until you have enough evidence that it’s worth it.

### **(10:26) Speaker 5 (Ankit) Joins**

- Apologizes for being late due to internet issues.

### **(10:34) Conversation Focus: Android Payment Approach**

- **Speaker 4** recaps: to expand to India, they need to handle Android payments.
- **Speaker 5 (Ankit)** says:
  - Apple Pay forces third-party payment flows to be intentionally cumbersome.
  - On **Android**, the user experience is more flexible. Possibly using Indeed’s existing billing platform (Adyen) might be better than building a fresh integration with Google Play’s in-app purchases.

#### **Key Concept**:

- **Adyen** is the enterprise-grade payment processor Indeed uses for **employer** billing globally.
- If the team can leverage that for job seekers, it might save development time and reduce complexity.

### **(11:56) ME (You)**

- Raise the idea: If on iOS, you rely on Apple Pay’s in-app subscription flow. For Android, do we rely on **Google Play** or do we bring in **Adyen**?
- Summarize that you need to do a **technical investigation** to understand which route is simpler or better for user experience.

### **(12:43) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Emphasizes reusing the **existing platform (Adyen)** for Android if possible.
- Points out that having multiple systems can create duplication or accounting complexity.

### **(13:27) ME (You)**

- Clarify you still want a frictionless experience.
- Restate that, yes, your team will do some feasibility checks on using Adyen vs. Google Play.

### **(13:41) Speaker 1**

- Checks feasibility: “If we use Adyen for Android, can we also do web?” Short answer: **Yes**.

### **(14:10) ME (You)**

- Notes that web is a smaller audience, so your main push is to get Android up and running.

### **(14:13) Speaker 1**

- Wraps up that point: the important next step is to confirm if using Adyen on Android would cause any major user friction or dev overhead.

### **(14:45) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Mentions for **employers**, Adyen works globally on web. Mobile is fine except for Apple Pay (where Apple is too restrictive).
- They’ll do a deeper check on how Adyen works in an **Android app** flow specifically for subscriptions.

### **(15:01) ME (You)**

- Suggest a plan: put together a **two-path** or **options** document describing:
  1. Adyen integration.
  2. Potential direct Google Play integration.

### **(15:42) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Mentions that using Apple’s in-app purchase for iOS was the only real option.
- For Android, they are leaning heavily on “don’t build brand-new, just reuse Indeed’s platform.”

### **(15:56) ME (You)**

- Affirm you’ll follow up with Kim’s team to confirm any needed legal or procurement steps if a new vendor is introduced.

### **(16:21) Speaker 3 (Riaz)**

- Asks clarifying questions: “You said the billing platform is used by employers globally—web and mobile? So, it’s set up for **all** but Apple Pay, correct?”

### **(16:56) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Confirms that’s correct. Apple is the outlier.

### **(17:17) Speaker 3 (Riaz)**

- Understands the coverage. Good to know.

### **(17:21) Speaker 4 (Pearl)**

- Switches to the **advertiser ID** topic. Points out that for **employers**, Indeed uses an ID-based structure in the billing system. For **job seekers**, that’s not yet built.

### **(18:08) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Reiterates that turning the employer-centric billing platform into something job-seeker-friendly requires some dev effort.
- They have to figure out the timeline for making that a priority.

### **(18:28) Speaker 4 (Pearl)**

- Asks “**When** do we need job seeker advertiser IDs?” i.e., is it urgent or only once the product is scaling?

### **(19:06) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Says they will need it eventually for more robust data flows. But it might not be crucial at the **pilot** stage when volumes are tiny.

### **(19:10) Speaker 1**

- Shares the **roadmap** for Job Seeker Premium:
  1. **Pilot in Canada** is brand new, maybe 2–3 months of iteration for funnel optimization.
  2. Once they see enough traction, they’ll consider scaling up or launching in India.
  3. Realistically, that’s \~2 months out (in an ideal scenario).

### **(19:58) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Explains that if Indeed invests in reworking the billing platform now, it needs to be sure the product is worth it.

### **(20:25) Speaker 1**

- Acknowledges that. Still, they need to test a paid offering in India to see if it resonates.

### **(21:25) ME (You)**

- Mentions that they reached an informal threshold with **Kim’s team**: “We’d only do bigger accounting changes once monthly revenue hits around **$10k/month** from iOS.”
- Suggests a parallel approach on Android: pilot until you near a certain revenue threshold, then implement the big changes for job seeker IDs, etc.

### **(22:49) Speaker 1**

- Seeks confirmation from Ankit or Pearl: “Can we do something similar with Android, meaning we don’t do the big overhaul until we see enough traction?”

### **(22:55) ME (You)**

- Explains the “chicken-and-egg” problem: you need to charge job seekers to see if they’ll pay (to validate your product). But you don’t want to invest in heavy billing changes if the product fizzles.

### **(23:06) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Believes that’s a reasonable approach. Confirms a “low-volume pilot” can use existing solutions with minimal overhead. Only once it scales do they need the full compliance infrastructure.

### **(24:36) Speaker 1**

- Summarizes the plan:
  1. Keep using **Career Services**-style minimal approach for small volumes of job seeker payments.
  2. Move to the “official” job seeker advertiser ID approach if/when the business scales.

### **(25:00) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Agrees. Points out again they want to avoid duplication in the long run, but for now, minimal duplication is acceptable if it means faster testing.

### **(25:35) Speaker 1**

- Confirms that’s the pragmatic approach.
- States that eventually, Indeed wants a single system for both employers and job seekers. But right now, the priority is proving **product-market fit**.

### **(26:06) Speaker 5 (Ankit)**

- Reminds everyone that scaling beyond a pilot means Indeed must be sure it’s the “right” investment.
- The existing **employer** Adyen system can be extended, but it’s not trivial.

### **(27:25) ME (You)**

- Returns to the timeline: Canada data alone might not predict India outcomes, so they want to test India with real subscription payments.
- After enough data, the team can confirm if the investment is justified.

### **(28:33) Speaker 1**

- Clarifies that capacity/bandwidth within the dev team is also a factor—everyone is busy.
- Tentatively 2 months from now, the team might test in India if the capacity is there.

### **(29:04) ME (You) + Speaker 1**

- Agree on next steps: a thorough **technical investigation** of potential Android solutions.
- Then check effort with Ankit’s group.

### **(30:10) Speaker 4 (Pearl)**

- Checks if they need anything else from them or from Kim. Possibly more details on reporting or compliance if volumes grow.

### **(30:27) ME (You) & Speaker 3 (Riaz)**

- Confirm Mark G. is already looped in. He’s in Treasury.
- They’ll coordinate offline for any deeper details.

### **(31:00) Speaker 4 (Pearl)**

- Concludes the main discussion. The group reaffirms:
  1. **Pilot approach** to reduce complexity.
  2. Migrate to a more robust solution once revenue/usage crosses certain thresholds.

### **(32:33) Speaker 1**

- Thanks everyone, ends the call.

## Key Discussion Threads in More Detail

1. **Job Seeker Premium Status**
   - **Objective**: Monetize job seeker resources (e.g., premium features, additional support).
   - **Canada iOS**: Very early pilot; only a handful of subscribers have moved past the 7-day free trial.
   - **Goals**: Prove viability, refine funnel, watch for churn/retention.

2. **India Expansion & Android**
   - **Reason**: India is an enormous market, predominantly using Android. Testing a paid product there quickly verifies if the model can work globally.
   - **Payment Choices**:
     - **Google Play Billing**: Potentially easy for user checkouts, but might require a new vendor relationship and more overhead.
     - **Adyen**: Reuse Indeed’s existing system, though originally built for employers. Minimizes new vendor overhead but might require retooling to handle job seekers.

3. **Compliance & Accounting**
   - **Threshold**: If monthly revenue is under 10k, simpler “pilot-level” processes might suffice. Once it goes above that, advanced financial accounting processes must be put in place (especially for multi-currency markets).
   - **Advertiser IDs**: The current Adyen-based solution uses an “advertiser” concept for employers. Indeed needs a parallel or expanded system for job seekers to track subscriptions properly.
   - **Legal & Procurement**:
     - **Kim’s team** and **Mark G.** in Treasury are the go-to resources for vendor contracts, compliance, and financial flows.
     - They already gave a “small pilot pass” on iOS, but scaling to new geos might trigger more formal steps.

4. **Zero-to-One Product Strategy**
   - **Iterative**: Start small, measure, iterate on the funnel.
   - **Multi-Region Testing**: Canada (smaller, stable environment) is a stepping stone to bigger markets like India.
   - **Minimal Viable Process**: Avoid overbuilding. If the product underperforms, they save time and cost. If it succeeds, they pivot to a robust setup quickly.

---

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Technical Feasibility Analysis**
   - **ME (You)** and engineering team will investigate **Android** payment options:
     - Path A: **Google Play**
     - Path B: **Adyen**
   - Evaluate user experience and development complexity for each approach.

2. **Coordinate with Ankit’s Team**
   - Once the product team decides which approach is feasible, **Speaker 5 (Ankit)** and the **billing systems team** will assess needed changes to the “employer” billing platform for job seekers.

3. **Engage Kim & Mark G.**
   - Determine compliance, legal, and reporting requirements.
   - Confirm revenue thresholds at which deeper accounting processes must be activated.

4. **Set Roadmap**
   - Based on pilot results in Canada, the team will decide when to **officially push** Job Seeker Premium to India (and possibly other markets).
   - If traction is good, begin the **job seeker advertiser ID** integration.
   - If not, continue iterating in Canada until there’s enough confidence.

---

## Core Takeaways

- **Launch Quickly, Validate, Then Scale**: Everyone aligns on the “zero-to-one” principle: build minimal, test, measure, and only scale up the billing infrastructure once the subscription model proves itself.
- **Payment Complexity**:
  - Apple iOS: in-app purchase is basically forced.
  - Android: more freedom, but deciding between direct Google Play vs. leveraging Indeed’s existing Adyen platform for a single, consistent billing system.
- **Regulatory & Accounting Hurdles**: Payment flows must be compliant with global finance rules. However, for small pilots, Indeed can operate in a more flexible mode until revenue volume triggers robust compliance.

---

### How This Links Back to Broader Knowledge

1. **Market Expansion Lessons**: When introducing a paid product to new geographies (like India), you often face not just localization challenges but also **local platform preferences** (Android vs. iOS in market share).
2. **Monetization Playbook**: Standard approach:
   - Start with a single region and payment method (low overhead).
   - Add more payment methods and internal finance alignment only when you have proven demand.
3. **Zero-to-One vs. Scale**: A consistent tension in startups or new product lines. You don’t want to waste dev cycles or overhead building enterprise-ready systems if the product itself might pivot or fail.

---

#### Final Note

This conversation illustrates **practical cross-team collaboration** at Indeed:

- **Product** (You, Speaker 1) focusing on user experience and product-market fit.
- **Payments/Finance** (Speaker 5, Kim, Mark G.) ensuring compliance and stable financial operations.
- **Systems** (Speaker 4, representing Financial Systems) bridging the gap between product needs and the existing enterprise billing solution.
- **Program Management** (Speaker 3) facilitating alignment and follow-ups.

That level of cross-functional synergy is typical in larger tech organizations when a new paid feature rolls out. By following these steps—**pilot**, **assess**, **iterate**, **scale**—the teams aim to minimize risk while maximizing learning.

New Products
The Premium team is looking to expand payment methods beyond Apple (iOS) for job seekers. Currently, Premium is offered in Canada on iOS via Apple In App Purchase.
Next major target market: India, where most of the audience is on Android.
Q: How to enable payments there?
Google Play’s in-app purchases
Adyen, Indeed’s existing Indeed payment platform
Adyen	offers an Android SDK and could offer one-click payments, like Apple’s IAP


Q: When to enable job seeker-based payments on the payments and billing platform





Current Products
The Canada pilot is extremely early. The team wants to refine the funnel, improve retention, and gather proof of product market fit before scaling up








The product team needs to figure out how to incorporate multiple payment solutions (Apple Pay, Google Pay, or direct credit card processing via the existing Indeed employer platform) without creating friction for users or duplicating efforts behind the scenes


Reusing Indeed’s existing Adyen platform could be simpler and more maintainable in the long run, but the product team will explore the technical friction vs. the conversion benefits of each solution.

**Integration Decisions & Considerations**

- The team acknowledges that **Apple In-App Purchase** is the simplest path on iOS, but Apple’s restrictions limit alternative payment methods on that platform.
- On **Android**, there is flexibility:
  - **Google Play Billing** could provide a near-seamless in-app experience.
  - **Adyen** is Indeed’s existing billing platform (currently used by employers).
    - Could be extended for job seeker subscriptions.
    - Would require reworking “advertiser ID” logic so it can handle job seeker accounts.
- **Potential Friction**: Implementing a brand-new payment method (Google Play Billing) vs. reusing Adyen. Balancing user experience (one-click purchase) with internal complexity.

---

**Timeline & Roadmap**

- Canada iOS Pilot:
  - Extremely early stage, only a small handful of paid subscribers after the free trial.
  - The team will **spend the next 1–2 months** refining conversion funnels and retention before deciding to scale.
- India Market Test:
  - Likely \~2 months out, depending on capacity and Canada metrics.
  - Primary focus is **Android** given India’s user base. The team wants to run real payment experiments to confirm product viability in that market.
- Future Expansion:
  - If Canada + India show promising results, they have approval from leadership (Chris) to scale to additional geographies or platforms.

---

**Advertiser IDs & Billing Platform Updates**

- Current Adyen implementation is designed around **employer billing**; it tracks spend through “advertiser IDs.”
- **Job Seeker Billing** would require:
  - New record structures or logic to assign unique job seeker IDs.
  - Additional financial / accounting flows to separate job seeker revenue from employer revenue.
- **Threshold Approach**:
  - Similar to Career Services, a formal job seeker ID system might only be strictly required once revenue exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $10k/month).
  - While revenue is small (pilot phase), Indeed can operate in a more **lightweight** manner.

---

**Compliance & Accounting Requirements**

- **Kim’s Team**: Overseeing legal, accounting, and procurement processes.
- **Mark G.** (Treasury) is a point of contact for **payment flows and vendor contracts**.
- The group agreed that **deeper compliance** steps will be necessary if/when monthly revenue scales, but minimal processes suffice for now.

---

**User Experience & Conversion**

- Team wants to **avoid added friction** at checkout; a smooth payment flow is critical for retaining users who might otherwise drop off.
- **Apple Pay** is straightforward on iOS because Apple enforces it.
- **Adyen** on Android can provide a single integrated experience across web and mobile—potentially simpler for internal tracking and finances.

**Action Items & Next Steps**

1. **Technical Feasibility Study**
   - Compare **Google Play Billing** vs. **Adyen** for Android.
   - Assess user flow, engineering complexity, and compliance overhead.
2. **Coordinate with Payments Team**
   - Work with **Ankit’s** team to understand modifications needed to reuse the employer Adyen flow for job seekers.
   - Determine potential timelines and scope of work.
3. **Engage Kim & Mark G.**
   - Validate thresholds for deeper accounting, vendor agreements, or additional legal requirements.
   - Confirm the exact monthly revenue limit that triggers a formal job seeker advertiser ID system.
4. **Monitor Canada Pilot Metrics**
   - Keep iterating on the funnel, track free-to-paid conversion, gauge retention.
   - Decide whether results justify an **India pilot** for Android in \~2 months.
5. **Establish a Scalable Model**
   - If pilot success is confirmed, unify job seeker billing under a consistent platform (Adyen) or finalize an approach with Google Play for Android.
   - Create a roadmap for full compliance, robust accounting, and easy user flows.

**Conclusion**

- The group agreed on a **phased approach**:
  - Continue minimal, **small-scale revenue collection** through existing methods (Apple In-App Purchase in Canada, possibly Adyen for Android).
  - Expand only once there’s sufficient product-market fit and user uptake to warrant bigger investments in billing infrastructure.
- The next key milestone is to **finalize a payment strategy** for the Indian market on Android and to see if the Canada iOS pilot meets initial conversion and retention targets.
