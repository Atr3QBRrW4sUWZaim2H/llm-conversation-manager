Determining “how many conversions” you need before you can confidently say your observed conversion rate is close to the “true” conversion rate boils down to a **sample-size problem** for estimating a binomial proportion. In other words, you’re looking for enough **conversions** (successes) so that the confidence interval around your observed conversion rate (p̂) is suitably narrow.

Below is a step-by-step way to think about it, along with a simple rule-of-thumb formula often used in product analytics and A/B testing contexts.

---

## 1. The Usual Approach: Sample Size for a Proportion

When you measure a conversion rate $ p $ (a binomial proportion), the **margin of error (ME)** in a confidence interval is (roughly):

$
\text{ME} = z \times \sqrt{\frac{p\,(1 - p)}{n}}
$

Where:
- $ p $ is the “true” (unknown) conversion rate (we typically approximate it with the observed $ \hat{p} $ after collecting some data).
- $ n $ is your total sample size (i.e., number of user sessions, emails sent, or pageviews exposed to the new experience).
- $ z $ is the z-value tied to your desired confidence level (e.g., $z \approx 1.96$ for 95% confidence).

### But You Asked: “How many **conversions** do I need?”

- The formula above directly gives you **total sample size** $n$.  
- The **number of conversions** is $n \times p$.  

If you don’t know $p$ upfront, a common **worst-case** assumption is $p = 0.5$ (since that yields the largest variance and thus the largest required sample size).

#### 1.1. Turning Margin of Error into Required Sample Size
Rearranging for $n$, if you want your margin of error to be $ \pm e $:

$
n \approx \frac{z^2 \times p(1 - p)}{e^2}
$

In the worst case $ p = 0.5 $:

$
n \approx \frac{z^2 \times 0.5 \times 0.5}{e^2} = \frac{z^2}{4\,e^2}
$

For example, at 95% confidence ($ z \approx 1.96 $):

- **Margin of error = 5%**: 
  $
  n = \frac{1.96^2}{4 \times 0.05^2} \approx 384 
  $
- **Margin of error = 3%**: 
  $
  n = \frac{1.96^2}{4 \times 0.03^2} \approx 1067 
  $
- **Margin of error = 2%**: 
  $
  n = \frac{1.96^2}{4 \times 0.02^2} \approx 2401 
  $

This $n$ tells you how many **visitors** (or user sessions, etc.) you need in total. Then, if your conversion rate is $p$, the expected **number of conversions** is $n \times p$.

---

## 2. Rule of Thumb for “Number of Conversions”

Many product managers and data scientists use some pragmatic **rules of thumb**:

1. **Aim for at least 100–200 conversions** (in each variant if it’s an A/B test) before placing strong trust in your observed conversion rate.  
2. If you need a tighter margin of error (say, you want to detect a small change in conversion rate), you’ll need **more conversions**—sometimes **hundreds or even thousands**.

The exact number ultimately depends on:
- Your required confidence level (often 90%, 95%, or 99%).
- The precision or margin of error $e$ you’re willing to tolerate (e.g., ±2% vs. ±5%).
- Your best guess or baseline for $p$. If you truly have **no clue**, you can conservatively set $p = 0.5$ to ensure you collect enough data for **any** true rate under 0.5.

---

## 3. Practical Steps to Get Started

1. **Collect a preliminary sample** to get a rough estimate of $ \hat{p} $.  
2. **Plug $ \hat{p} $ into the sample size formula** (instead of 0.5). This will give you a more realistic (usually smaller) required sample size for your desired margin of error.  
3. Keep measuring until you have at least that many total users and that many **conversions** so that your observed conversion rate’s confidence interval is sufficiently narrow.

---

## 4. Example Scenario

Suppose you’re launching a new onboarding experience and you suspect the conversion rate is around **20%**. You want a **±3% margin of error** at **95% confidence**. Then:

1. **Initial guess**: $ p = 0.20 $
2. $ z = 1.96 $ (95% confidence)
3. $ e = 0.03 $

Plugging in:

$
n = \frac{z^2 \times p(1 - p)}{e^2}
 = \frac{1.96^2 \times 0.20 \times 0.80}{(0.03)^2}
 \approx 683
$

- That means you need **683 total users** in your experiment *on average* to achieve ±3% precision (assuming your guess of 20% was accurate).  
- Expected **conversions** among those 683 users would be $683 \times 0.20 \approx 137$ conversions.

If your real conversion rate turned out to be 10% or 30%, the sample size needed would change accordingly.

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **There’s no single fixed number** of conversions that works for every scenario; it depends on the **confidence level** you want, the **margin of error**, and the **actual conversion rate**.  
- If you truly have no idea what your rate might be, use $ p=0.5 $ in the formula for a conservative estimate.  
- As a quick-and-dirty rule, many teams don’t even start trusting a new conversion rate measurement until they’ve seen **at least 100–200 conversions**.  
- Once you have preliminary data, refine your estimate of $ p $ and recalculate the sample size more accurately.

---

### In Summary

To be “confident” that the conversion rate you’re observing is close to the true conversion rate, you’ll want:

1. **A large enough sample** (total visitors / exposures) to yield  
2. **A sufficiently high count of conversions** so that  
3. **Your confidence interval** (e.g., 95% CI) is as tight as you need around $ \hat{p} $.

Using the formula:

$
n \approx \frac{z^2 \times p(1 - p)}{e^2}
$

is the standard way to determine how large $n$ (and hence how many conversions) you need. Once you pin down your desired margin of error $e$ and confidence level $z$, you can back into a good rule-of-thumb for “We need about X conversions to have a stable read on our conversion rate.”

Below is a practical approach for figuring out how many **total users** (i.e., exposures) and **conversions** you’ll need if you expect a baseline conversion rate (p̂) of around **1%**. The key is to decide on two things ahead of time:

1. Your desired **confidence level** (commonly 95%).
2. Your acceptable **margin of error** for that estimated conversion rate (e.g., ±0.2%, ±0.3%, etc.).

Once you decide on a margin of error ($ e $), you can use the standard sample size formula for estimating a binomial proportion:

$
n \;=\; \frac{z^2 \,\times\, p(1-p)}{e^2},
$

where

- $ p $ is the true (but unknown) conversion rate—approximated by your best guess ($ p \approx 0.01 $).
- $ z $ is the z-value corresponding to your desired confidence (for 95% confidence, $ z \approx 1.96 $).
- $ e $ is the desired absolute margin of error (e.g., 0.002 if you want $\pm 0.2\%$ around your estimate).

Once you have the total sample size $ n $, the **number of conversions** you expect is simply $ n \times p $.  

---

## Worked Examples (95% Confidence, $ p = 1\% $)

Let’s calculate $ n $ for various margins of error ($ e $) at 95% confidence. We’ll then show how many conversions that implies (on average). Keep in mind $ p(1-p) = 0.01 \times 0.99 = 0.0099 $.

$
n \;=\; \frac{(1.96)^2 \times 0.0099}{e^2}
\quad=\quad \frac{3.8416 \times 0.0099}{e^2}
\quad=\quad \frac{0.0380}{e^2}.
$

\| Desired Margin of Error (absolute) | $ e $    | $ n $ (Total Users) | Expected Conversions ($n \times p$) |
\|-----------------------------------|-----------:|----------------------:|----------------------------------------:|
\| ±0.5%  (0.005)                    | 0.005      | $\tfrac{0.0380}{0.005^2} \approx 1520$  | $1520 \times 0.01 \approx 15$         |
\| ±0.3%  (0.003)                    | 0.003      | $\tfrac{0.0380}{0.003^2} \approx 4222$  | $4222 \times 0.01 \approx 42$         |
\| ±0.2%  (0.002)                    | 0.002      | $\tfrac{0.0380}{0.002^2} \approx 9500$  | $9500 \times 0.01 \approx 95$         |
\| ±0.1%  (0.001)                    | 0.001      | $\tfrac{0.0380}{0.001^2} \approx 38000$ | $38000 \times 0.01 \approx 380$       |

### Interpretation

- If you’re okay with a **±0.5%** swing around your measured 1% (meaning you’d be content if the “true” rate is anywhere between 0.5% and 1.5%), you’d need around **1,520 total users** and expect **15 conversions** in that sample.
- If you want a tighter **±0.2%** margin of error, you need **9,500 users** (about **95 conversions**).
- Tighter margins of error require much larger samples—this is why, for small conversion rates, collecting enough data can be time-consuming.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Decide on a margin of error** (in absolute percentage points), because that sets how “close” to the true conversion rate you want your estimate to be.
2. **Use the sample size formula** with your best-guess $p$ (1% in your case) to find $ n $.
3. **Multiply $ n $ by $ p $** to get the **expected number of conversions** you need.
4. Remember this approach gives you an **average** or **expected** requirement. If your actual conversion rate differs from 1%, you’ll need to adjust.

---

### Practical Tip

- In early product experimentation (especially for low baseline rates like 1%), teams often aim for **at least 50–100 conversions** *minimum* to start feeling somewhat confident in the observed rate.
- If your product context demands very tight precision (e.g., you need to distinguish 1.0% from 1.2%), you might need **thousands or tens of thousands** of total exposures.

By setting a clear margin of error and confidence level, you can quickly back into how many total conversions (and thus total users) you’ll need for your new product experience.

Below is a typical way to estimate the **minimum detectable effect (MDE)**—i.e., the smallest absolute lift in conversion rate you can reliably detect—given:

1. A **baseline conversion rate** (here, 1%),
2. A **total number of conversions** (here, 5,500), and
3. Standard testing assumptions about statistical power and significance.

---

## 1. Figuring Out Your Total Sample Size

If your baseline conversion rate is $p = 1\%$ (0.01) and you have **5,500 total conversions**, then the total number of users (visitors, exposures, etc.) must be:

$
\text{Total sample} = \frac{\text{Total conversions}}{\text{Baseline conversion rate}}
= \frac{5500}{0.01}
= 550{,}000.
$

We’ll assume you plan to split this sample 50/50 between your **control** (baseline) group and your **treatment** (new variant) group, so each group has about **275,000** users on average.

---

## 2. Standard “MDE” Formula for A/B Tests

A common back-of-the-envelope formula for the Minimum Detectable Effect in a **two-sided** test at:

- $\alpha = 0.05$ (95% confidence)  
- $\beta = 0.20$ (80% power)  
- With **equal-sized** test groups

is:

$
\text{MDE} 
\;\approx\;
(z_{\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})
\;\sqrt{
  \frac{p(1-p)}{n_1}
  +
  \frac{p(1-p)}{n_2}
},
$

where:
- $z_{\alpha/2} \approx 1.96$ for a 95% confidence two-sided test,
- $z_{1-\beta} \approx 0.84$ for 80% power,
- $p$ is the baseline conversion rate (0.01),
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes in each group (275,000 each).

Because the groups are the same size, this simplifies to:

$
\text{MDE} 
\;\approx\;
(z_{\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})
\;\sqrt{
  2 \;\frac{p(1-p)}{n}
},
$

where $n = 275{,}000$ is the size *per* group.

---

### Plug in the Numbers

- $z_{\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta} = 1.96 + 0.84 = 2.80$
- $p(1-p) = 0.01 \times 0.99 = 0.0099$
- Each group size $n = 275{,}000$

So,

$
\text{MDE} 
\;\approx\; 
2.80 \times \sqrt{2 \;\frac{0.0099}{275{,}000}}
$

Let’s break that down step by step:

1. **Inside the square root**:  
   $
   2 \times \frac{0.0099}{275{,}000}
   = \frac{0.0198}{275{,}000}
   \approx 7.2 \times 10^{-8}
   $
2. **Square root**:  
   $
   \sqrt{7.2 \times 10^{-8}} 
   \;\approx\; 8.5 \times 10^{-5}
   \;=\; 0.000085
   $
3. **Multiply by 2.80**:  
   $
   2.80 \times 0.000085 
   \;\approx\; 0.000238 
   \;=\; 0.0238\%
   $

Hence:

$
\boxed{\text{MDE} \;\approx\; 0.024\% \text{ (absolute)}}
$

This means that, given a baseline of 1.0%, you’d be able to detect a shift to about **1.024%** (or higher) with \~95% confidence and 80% power, assuming equal split and 5,500 total conversions.

---

## 3. Interpretation

- This MDE is in **absolute percentage points**. Since your baseline is 1.0%, a **0.024 percentage-point** increase to \~1.024% is about a **2.4% relative lift**.
- Put differently, you **can’t** reliably detect an improvement smaller than \~2.4% (relative) above your 1% baseline with these sample/conversion counts (at 95% confidence and 80% power).

---

## 4. Key Reminders

1. **Power and Confidence**: If you require higher confidence (say 99%) or higher power (90%), the MDE would increase.
2. **Unequal Splits**: If you allocate traffic unevenly between control and variant, the required math changes slightly (and the MDE usually goes up).
3. **Time to Collect Data**: If it takes a while to gather 550,000 users at a 1% conversion rate, you’ll need to weigh that cost against how small a lift you actually need to detect.

---

### Bottom Line

**With about 550,000 total users (5,500 conversions at a 1% baseline)** and a standard 95% confidence / 80% power test, you can detect an absolute lift of roughly **0.024 percentage points**—i.e., from 1.00% up to about **1.024%**.


#### You:

what if i just want to detect 10% lifts or better

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-02-19T19:36:13.308Z" title="2/20/2025, 4:36:13 AM">04:36</time>

Below is a straightforward way to see **how many users** (and thus how many conversions) you’d need to reliably detect a **10% relative lift** over a baseline of **1%**—i.e., distinguishing **1.0%** from **1.1%**. We’ll assume a standard A/B test setup:

- **Two-sided** test (you care about lifts either up or down)
- **95% confidence** ($\alpha = 0.05$ $\Rightarrow z\_{\alpha/2} \approx 1.96$)
- **80% power** ($\beta = 0.20$ $\Rightarrow z\_{1-\beta} \approx 0.84$)
- **Equal splits** (half of users in Control, half in Treatment)

---

## 1. The Two-Proportion Test Formula

To detect a difference between two proportions $p_1$ and $p_2$ with equal-sized groups, the **per-group sample size** ($n\_1 = n\_2$) can be approximated by:

$
n_1 
= 
\bigl(z_{\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta}\bigr)^2 \;\frac{p_1 \bigl(1 - p_1\bigr) \;+\; p_2 \bigl(1 - p_2\bigr)}{\bigl(p_2 - p_1\bigr)^2}.
$

Since total $N = n_1 + n_2$, the total sample size is $2 \times n_1$.

---

### 1.1. Plugging in Your Numbers

- Baseline conversion rate: $p_1 = 1\%$ = 0.010  
- “10% lift” means the treatment rate: $p_2 = 0.011$ (i.e., from 1.0% to 1.1%)  
- $\alpha = 0.05 \Rightarrow z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$  
- $\beta = 0.20 \Rightarrow z_{1-\beta} = 0.84$  
- $\Delta = p_2 - p_1 = 0.001$

Hence:

$
(z_{\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta}) 
= 1.96 + 0.84 
= 2.80, 
\quad 
(z_{\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})^2 
= 2.80^2 
= 7.84.
$

Next, compute the combined variance term:
$
p_1(1 - p_1) + p_2(1 - p_2) 
= 0.010 \times 0.990 \;+\; 0.011 \times 0.989 
= 0.0099 \;+\; 0.010879 
= 0.020779.
$

Finally, since $(p_2 - p_1)^2 = (0.001)^2 = 1\times 10^{-6}$,

$
n_1 
= 7.84 \;\times\; \frac{0.020779}{\,1 \times 10^{-6}\,}
= 7.84 \;\times\; 20{,}779 
\approx 162{,}906.
$

So per-group, you need roughly **163,000 users**. For a two-arm test:

$
\text{Total } N \;=\; 2 \,\times\, n_1 
\;\approx\; 2 \,\times\, 163{,}000 
=\; 326{,}000.
$

---

## 2. Conversions Implied

If your **control** group of \~163k users converts at 1%, you get about **1,630 conversions** in control.\
If the **treatment** group truly converts at 1.1%, you get \~**1,793 conversions** there.\
That difference of \~163 conversions is (on average) enough for statistical significance at 95% confidence and 80% power.

---

## 3. Interpretation

1. **Total Sample Needed**: \~**326,000** users (split evenly into \~163k control / \~163k treatment) to detect a 0.1 percentage-point increase (a 10% relative lift from 1.0% to 1.1%).
2. **Total Conversions**: \~3,423 across both groups combined (1,630 + 1,793).
3. **Why Fewer Samples Than Smaller Lifts?** A bigger effect size (a 10% lift) is easier to spot, so you don’t need as large a sample as you would to detect a smaller lift (like a 2–3% relative change).

---

### Bottom Line

If you only need to confidently detect (or rule out) **10% lifts** from a 1% baseline, plan on roughly **300–350k total users** (generating \~3,000–3,500 total conversions). That will let you run a standard 95% confidence / 80% power test and reliably conclude whether your new experience truly improves the 1% baseline by at least 10%.

how many samples do i need to collect before i can determine that the conversion rate is not 3%

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-02-19T19:39:37.233Z" title="2/20/2025, 4:39:37 AM">04:39</time>

**Short Answer (Key Idea)**\
To show statistically that “the true conversion rate is not 3%,” you need to decide **how far from 3%** you must be before you want to confidently reject 3%. In other words, you must define an **alternative** (e.g., 2% or 4%) or a **minimum detectable difference** (MDD or MDE) from 3%. Once you pick:

1. A difference from 3% you care about (e.g., 1 percentage point away, meaning 2% or 4%),
2. A confidence level (often 95%), and
3. A desired statistical power (often 80%),

you can plug those into a **one-proportion z-test** formula (or an equivalent margin-of-error approach) to get the required sample size.

---

## 1. Why You Must Specify a “Difference” From 3%

- A statistical test needs a **null hypothesis** (H₀: *p* = 3%) and an **alternative** (H₁: *p* ≠ 3%).
- However, the number of samples you need depends on **how big the real rate actually is** compared to 3%. If it’s only slightly different (e.g., 2.9% vs. 3.0%), you need **many more samples** to detect that subtle difference with high confidence.
- Conversely, if the true rate is drastically different (e.g., 1% or 10%), you can detect that difference with **fewer samples**.

Hence, “How many samples do I need to confirm the rate isn’t 3%?” cannot be answered without specifying the **minimum distance** from 3% that you care to detect (the MDE).

---

## 2. One-Proportion Test Formula

A common approach is to do a **one-sample proportion z-test**. The typical formula for the required sample size *n* (for a two-sided test with significance $\alpha$ and power $1-\beta$) is:

$
n \;\ge\; 
\frac{
\bigl(z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\,p_0(1 - p_0)\,} + z_{1 - \beta} \sqrt{\,p_1(1 - p_1)\,}\bigr)^2
}{
\bigl(p_1 - p_0\bigr)^2
},
$

where:
- $p_0 = 0.03$ is the “null” (3%),
- $p_1$ is the “true” rate you want to detect (e.g., 2% or 4%),
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the z-value for your desired confidence (e.g., 1.96 for 95%),
- $z_{1-\beta}$ is the z-value for your desired power (e.g., 0.84 for 80%).

Once you compute _n_, if your actual (true) conversion rate is $p_1$, you’ll have ~80% chance (power) of statistically rejecting “p=3%” at the 5% significance level.

---

### Example: Detecting a ±1 Percentage-Point Difference (from 3% to 2% or 4%)

Suppose you say,  
- “I want 95% confidence ($\alpha=0.05$) and 80% power ($\beta=0.20$),”  
- “I’ll consider it ‘not 3%’ if the real rate is at most 2% or at least 4%.”  

You’re effectively testing H₀: $p=0.03$ vs. H₁: $p=0.02$ (lower side) or $p=0.04$ (upper side). In practice, you pick whichever side requires more samples (because 2% and 4% have slightly different variances).

1. **Case A: Actual rate = 2%** (a 1-point drop from 3%)  
   - $p_0(1-p_0) = 0.03 \times 0.97 = 0.0291$  
   - $p_1(1-p_1) = 0.02 \times 0.98 = 0.0196$  
   - $\,z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96,\; z_{1-\beta} = 0.84$  
   - Sum of z-terms times square roots:  
     $
       (1.96 \times \sqrt{0.0291}) \;+\; (0.84 \times \sqrt{0.0196})
       \;\approx\; 0.334 \;+\; 0.118
       \;=\; 0.452.
     $  
   - Square it: $0.452^2 \approx 0.204$.  
   - Divide by $(p_1 - p_0)^2 = (0.02 - 0.03)^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001$.  
   - $n \approx 0.204 / 0.0001 = 2040$ samples.  

2. **Case B: Actual rate = 4%** (a 1-point rise from 3%)  
   - $p_1(1-p_1) = 0.04 \times 0.96 = 0.0384$  
   - Sum of z-terms times square roots:  
     $
       (1.96 \times \sqrt{0.0291}) \;+\; (0.84 \times \sqrt{0.0384})
       \;\approx\; 0.334 \;+\; 0.165
       \;=\; 0.499.
     $  
   - Square it: $0.499^2 \approx 0.249$.  
   - Divide by $(0.01)^2 = 0.0001$.  
   - $n \approx 0.249 / 0.0001 = 2490$ samples.  

**Interpretation:**  
- If the *actual* rate is 2%, you need **~2,040 samples** to have 80% power to reject “3%.”  
- If the *actual* rate is 4%, you need **~2,490 samples**.  
- Because you don’t know in advance if it’s lower or higher, you typically plan for the **larger** $n$, about ~2,500 samples.  

Once you collect ~2,500 data points (and if the true rate is really 2% or 4%), you’ll have ~80% chance to conclude at 95% confidence that it’s not 3%.

## 3. Alternative Simpler Approach: Margin of Error for a Single Proportion

Another perspective is to ask: “How many samples must I gather so that the **95% confidence interval** around my measured rate no longer includes 3%?” If you’re measuring an observed rate $\hat{p}$, the approximate margin of error (ME) is:

$
\text{ME} 
= 
z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}.
$

You want `3%` to be *outside* your confidence interval. That means you want:

$
|\;\hat{p} - 0.03\;| > \text{ME}.
$

- If $\hat{p}$ ends up being far from 3%, you need **fewer** samples to exclude 3% from the interval.
- If $\hat{p}$ ends up close to 3%, you need **a lot more** samples to be sure it’s not exactly 3%.

Because you can’t know $\hat{p}$ in advance, you either pick a plausible “actual” rate or target a margin of error small enough that the final confidence interval can’t contain 3%.

## 4. Key Takeaways

1. **You must define how different from 3% you want to detect** (the MDE). Detecting a change from 3% to 2.99% is much harder (more data) than detecting a change from 3% to 2.0% or 5.0%.
2. **Use a standard one-proportion sample-size formula** (or margin-of-error formula) with your chosen difference, confidence level (e.g., 95%), and power (e.g., 80%).
3. If you suspect a **1 percentage-point difference** (e.g., from 3% to 2% or 4%), you’ll likely need **\~2,000–2,500 total samples** to confirm that difference with standard 95%/80% criteria.

In short, **pin down the smallest difference from 3% that matters to you**. Then use either the one-proportion test formula (shown above) or a margin-of-error approach to compute how many samples are required before you can confidently claim the conversion rate is *not* 3%.

**Short Answer**\
Yes, the reasoning and math in the previous explanation are correct for a **one-proportion test** aimed at showing “the true conversion rate is not 3%.” The answer correctly demonstrates that:

1. You must pick a **minimum difference** (from 3%) you care to detect—e.g., 2% or 4%—because detecting 2.9% vs. 3.0% requires far more samples than detecting 2.0% vs. 3.0%.
2. Once you do, you use standard formulas (with chosen confidence and power) to compute the required sample size.

Below is a **quick verification** of the key steps, confirming the correctness of the calculations and logic.

## 1. The Core One-Proportion Test Formula

When testing $H_0: p = p_0$ vs. $H_1: p \neq p_0$, for a desired significance $\alpha$ (often 0.05 for 95% confidence) and power $1 - \beta$ (often 0.80), a common **approximate** formula for the required sample size is:

$
n \;\ge\; 
\frac{
\left(
   z_{\alpha/2}\,\sqrt{p_0\,(1 - p_0)} 
   \;+\;
   z_{1 - \beta}\,\sqrt{p_1\,(1 - p_1)}
\right)^2
}{
(p_1 - p_0)^2
},
$

where\
- $p_0$ is the “null” rate (3% in the example),\
- $p_1$ is the “true” rate you want to detect (e.g., 2% or 4%),\
- $z_{\alpha/2} \approx 1.96$ for a two-sided 95% confidence,\
- $z_{1-\beta} \approx 0.84$ for 80% power,\
- $(p_1 - p_0)$ is the absolute difference you care to detect.

Since you don’t know the actual $p_1$ in advance, you pick a **minimum detectable effect** (MDE) from 3%. If the true rate is at least that far from 3%, you’ll have your desired power to reject $H\_0$.

## 2. Example Computation is Correct

**Case A**: Detecting 2% vs. 3%\
- $p_0 = 0.03, \quad p_1 = 0.02,\quad \Delta = 0.01.$ 
- $\sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)} \approx \sqrt{0.0291} \approx 0.1706.$ 
- $\sqrt{p_1(1 - p_1)} \approx \sqrt{0.0196} \approx 0.14.$ 
- $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96,\;\; z_{1-\beta} = 0.84.$ 

- Term 1: $1.96 \times 0.1706 \approx 0.334.$ 
- Term 2: $0.84 \times 0.14 \approx 0.118.$ 
- Sum: $0.334 + 0.118 \approx 0.452.$ 
- Square it: $0.452^2 \approx 0.204.$ 
- Divide by $\Delta^2 = 0.01^2 = 0.0001 \implies n \approx 2040.$

  **Case B**: Detecting 4% vs. 3%\
  - $p_0 = 0.03, \quad p_1 = 0.04,\quad \Delta = 0.01.$ 
  - $\sqrt{p_1(1 - p_1)} = \sqrt{0.0384} \approx 0.196.$ 
- Term 2: $0.84 \times 0.196 \approx 0.1645.$ 
- Sum: $0.334 + 0.1645 \approx 0.4985.$ 
- Square: $0.4985^2 \approx 0.2485.$ 
- Divide by $0.0001 \implies n \approx 2485.$ 

Hence to detect **either** 2% or 4% (i.e., a ±1 percentage-point shift from 3%), you’d plan on the **larger** requirement, \~2,500 samples. That ensures \~80% power at \~95% confidence to reject $p=3\%$ if the true rate is at least 1 point away.

## 3. Margin-of-Error Perspective is Also Valid

The previous answer also mentioned using a **confidence interval** approach: you keep sampling until your 95% CI around $\hat{p}$ no longer includes 3%. If $\hat{p}$ ends up near 2% or 4%, that will happen relatively quickly. If $\hat{p}$ is near 2.9%, you’ll need more data to be sure it’s not 3.0%.

---

### **Conclusion**

- The formulas, numbers, and reasoning in that answer **are correct** for a one-proportion test around 3%.
- The key point remains: “How many samples do I need?” depends on **what difference from 3%** you want to reliably exclude.
