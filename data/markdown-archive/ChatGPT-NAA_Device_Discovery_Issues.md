From these log entries, it looks like you’re running HQPlayer (or similar software using Network Audio Adapters, “NAA”) and it’s continuously scanning for devices on your network. You’re seeing two primary messages repeated:

1. **NAA Device Discovered**
   ```
   & 2025/01/14 22:16:27 NAA output discovered network audio: name='Red' version='Signalyst Network Audio Daemon 5.0.0' @192.168.1.176:43210
   ```
   This means HQPlayer (or your chosen NAA host) sees a network endpoint called **“Red”** running **Signalyst Network Audio Daemon 5.0.0** at that IP address. Every time you see “NAA output discovered 1 Network Audio Adapters,” it’s HQPlayer announcing that it has found exactly one active NAA device, which in this case is “Red.”

2. **Adapter Not Found**
   ```
   ? 2025/01/14 22:16:14 NAA output adapter 'ropieee [RoPieeeXL]' not found
   ```
   This implies HQPlayer is *also* trying to discover or connect to a device named “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]” but cannot find it on the network. This suggests that either:
   - The “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]” adapter is offline or not properly configured, or

   - The name of the adapter doesn’t match what the device is broadcasting, so HQPlayer can’t link them.

## Why “Red” Keeps Appearing

The logs show “Red” multiple times because HQPlayer/NAA discovery runs periodically. Each time it scans your network (both IPv4 and IPv6), it re-announces the devices it finds. That’s why you see repeated lines like:

```
NAA output discovery from 0.0.0.0
NAA output discovery from ::
```

Those lines just indicate that HQPlayer is listening on both IPv4 (`0.0.0.0`) and IPv6 (`::`) for broadcast/advertising packets.

## Why “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]” is “Not Found”

If you were previously using a RoPieeeXL endpoint (for instance, a Raspberry Pi running RoPieeeXL as a Roon Bridge + NAA), HQPlayer might still have an old configuration referencing that device. If the Pi is offline, on a different network, or no longer configured as “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL],” HQPlayer won’t see it and logs a “not found” message.

Sometimes, simple misconfiguration—like changing the hostname on the RoPieee device (or reinstalling the OS)—can cause HQPlayer to mismatch the name.

## What You Can Do

1. **Check if RoPieeeXL is Still in Use**
   - If you’re not using RoPieeeXL anymore, you can remove that adapter configuration from HQPlayer’s settings.
   - If you do want to use RoPieeeXL, ensure your Pi is powered on, connected to the same network, and configured to run HQPlayer NAA.

2. **Verify the Adapter Name**
   - In HQPlayer’s NAA settings, confirm the name matches the actual broadcast name of your RoPieee device. Sometimes RoPieee is just seen as “ropieee” or “ropieeeXL.” Matching the name exactly is important.

3. **Check Firmware/Software**
   - If you are running RoPieeeXL as an NAA, make sure it’s updated. RoPieeeXL includes a HQPlayer NAA module that should be the same (or a compatible) version of the NAA daemon.
   - If the versions mismatch, you might see intermittent discovery problems.

4. **Confirm IP Addresses**
   - The “Red” device is at `192.168.1.176:43210`. If your RoPieee device is also supposed to be on that network, confirm it’s pulling an address in that same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.xxx).

5. **Review IPv6 vs IPv4**
   - Because you see log lines with `NAA output discovery from ::` (IPv6) and from `0.0.0.0` (IPv4), it’s worth checking if RoPieeeXL might only be broadcasting on one protocol or the other. Sometimes a device can appear on IPv4 but not on IPv6 (or vice versa).

## Broader Context: Network Audio Adapter (NAA) Basics

- **HQPlayer** can offload or stream audio to a small device on your network using the Network Audio Daemon (Signalyst’s NAA).
- The small device (like a Raspberry Pi, Allo USBridge, or Sonore microRendu) runs software that identifies itself to HQPlayer.
- HQPlayer continuously scans the network for NAA endpoints, which is why you see repeated “discovery” messages.

Given your interest in deeper audio topics (like upsampling, DSD, and network streaming), it’s worth exploring how HQPlayer’s advanced DSP features integrate with NAA endpoints. For instance, you could:

- Upsample PCM to high-rate PCM or DSD on the host machine.

- Output via the NAA device (“Red” or “RoPieeeXL”) feeding a USB DAC.

## Summary

Your logs confirm that HQPlayer sees exactly one NAA device named **“Red”**, running Signalyst 5.0.0 at `192.168.1.176:43210`. However, HQPlayer is also trying to find an NAA labeled **“ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]”** and not succeeding. If you need that RoPieeeXL endpoint working, check its configuration (IP address, firmware version, name). If you no longer use RoPieeeXL, you can remove or ignore those messages in HQPlayer’s settings.

Overall, the repeated “discovery” entries and “not found” errors are typical logs for HQPlayer scanning your network but not finding everything it expects. By aligning device names, ensuring they’re powered on, and checking the correct versions, you’ll clear those messages and have your NAA endpoints working properly.

Removing a leftover RoPieeeXL adapter entry in HQPlayer depends on which version (Desktop or Embedded) you’re running. Below are common methods for each scenario:

---

## HQPlayer **Desktop** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

1. **Open HQPlayer** on your computer.
2. Go to **File** → **Settings** (on Windows) or **HQPlayer** → **Preferences** (on macOS). On Linux, it’s often under the main menu bar as well.
3. In the **Settings/Preferences** window:
   - Navigate to the tab labeled **“Backend/Output”**, **“Devices”**, or **“Network”** (the exact tab name can vary by HQPlayer version).
   - Look for an entry or dropdown list for **Network Audio Adapters** (NAA).
   - If you see **“ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]”** listed anywhere, **deselect** or **remove** it from the configured output device(s).
4. Click **OK** or **Apply** to save changes.

Once you remove or deselect “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL],” HQPlayer will no longer attempt to connect to that device, and the “not found” log messages should stop.

> **Tip**: If HQPlayer is automatically scanning for the NAA by name, look for an “Auto” or “Automatic” device discovery option. If enabled, HQPlayer will list every NAA it finds—even if it’s disconnected. Manually choosing only “Red” (your active NAA) can prevent spurious scans for old devices.

---

## HQPlayer **Embedded** or **HQPlayer OS**

1. **Open the HQPlayer Embedded Web Interface**. Point your browser to the IP address of your HQPlayer Embedded device (e.g., `http://192.168.1.xxx/`).
2. Look for a **Configuration** or **Settings** section in the web interface.
3. Within that section, you should find:
   - **Output mode** (e.g., “Network Audio Output” or “NAA”).
   - A list of discovered NAA endpoints.
4. If “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]” is displayed, **uncheck** or **de-select** it from any active output setting.
5. Save or **Apply** your new settings.

Again, if HQPlayer Embedded was specifically told to use “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]” before, removing it from the active output section will stop those “not found” log lines.

---

## If You Still See “Ropieee \[RoPieeeXL] Not Found” in Logs

- **Check Auto-Discovery**: Some older HQPlayer versions still show discovered NAA device names in logs even if you don’t select them. If logs keep showing “not found,” confirm you’ve explicitly chosen **“Red”** (your current NAA) in the HQPlayer settings.
- **Edit/Reset Config Files**: On **HQPlayer Desktop**, advanced users can edit the config file (`hqplayer.xml`) in your home directory (e.g., `~/.hqplayer/hqplayer.xml` on Linux/macOS). Removing references to “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]” can be done manually there. For **HQPlayer Embedded**, you might do a “Restore Defaults” from the web interface and reconfigure your current device.

---

### Broader Network Audio Adapters (NAA) Notes

- **Discovery**: HQPlayer regularly scans IPv4 (`0.0.0.0`) and IPv6 (`::`) for devices running Signalyst Network Audio Daemon. If you see repeated “NAA output discovered network audio” messages, that’s normal—HQPlayer is just announcing it sees “Red” each time.
- **Version Matching**: If you choose to re-use a RoPieeeXL or another NAA, ensure the Signalyst NAA version matches or is compatible with HQPlayer’s version.
- **Simplify**: If you only want to use the “Red” endpoint, make it the only selected device in HQPlayer’s settings. That way, HQPlayer stops scanning for or referencing the RoPieeeXL endpoint.

Removing the adapter reference should streamline your HQPlayer logs and ensure HQPlayer only tries to use your current “Red” endpoint. If you later decide to bring a RoPieeeXL-based NAA back, simply re-enable it in HQPlayer’s settings.

From the logs, we can see HQPlayer Desktop is failing (exit status **255**) when run as a systemd service, and systemd then attempts to restart it repeatedly until it gives up. An exit code of **255** is usually a generic error, so we need to figure out **why** HQPlayer is bailing out. Below are common troubleshooting steps and things to check:

---

## 1. Verify You Can Run HQPlayer Manually

Before relying on systemd, make sure the exact command in `ExecStart` runs **successfully** in a normal shell session. That means:

1. **Switch to user `ashwin`** if you’re not already:
   ```bash
   sudo su - ashwin
   ```
   or use `ssh` to log in directly as `ashwin`.
2. **Run the same command** from the unit file:
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
       --oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long \
       --filter=poly-sinc-ext3 \
       --modulator=asdm7ecv3 \
       --rate=DSD512 \
       --dither=TPDF \
       --integrator=fir2 \
       --conversion=xfi \
       --directsdm \
       --cuda-offload \
       --gpu=0 \
       --fft=32768 \
       --backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" \
       --device "Red" \
       --sdp=DoP \
       --adaptive-rate \
       --buffer-time=50 \
       --48kdsd \
       --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
   ```
3. **Check the console output**. You’ll see if HQPlayer fails with a particular error message (like an unrecognized parameter, license issue, missing library, etc.).

If it **does not** run successfully here, the console output should give a clue (e.g., missing GPU driver, unrecognized modulator, unknown backend, or license issue). If it **does** run successfully, then the issue might be specific to the systemd environment.

---

## 2. Confirm Dependencies and X11 Environment

You’re using:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop
```

Because HQPlayer Desktop is a GUI application, it typically expects an X11 environment. By wrapping it with **`xvfb-run`**, you’re creating a virtual X server to let it run headless.

- **Check if `xvfb` is installed**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install xvfb
  ```
- **Verify** there are **no** conflicting X servers or permission issues.
- The `-a` option in `xvfb-run` automatically picks a free X11 display number, but if that fails for some reason, HQPlayer can’t start.

Sometimes, **`xvfb-run`** will fail silently if your environment lacks certain fonts or X11 dependencies. Look in your system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl`) for any hints.

---

## 3. Check the HQPlayer Log File

You’ve specified:

```
--logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
```

After the crash, open that file to see if HQPlayer logged an explicit error:

```bash
less /home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
```

Typical issues logged might include:

- **License** not found or invalid.
- **Device name** mismatch (e.g., “Red” not recognized).
- **Unsupported** filter or modulator (less common if you know they normally work).
- **GPU** driver or `cuda-offload` issue.

If the log is **empty** or incomplete, it could mean HQPlayer never got far enough to log anything, or it crashed before it could write data.

---

## 4. Confirm GPU & CUDA Availability

You’re specifying:

```
--cuda-offload
--gpu=0
```

Make sure your server actually has **NVIDIA drivers** with CUDA installed. If HQPlayer tries to use CUDA on a system with no NVIDIA GPU or missing drivers, it can fail abruptly:

1. Check if you have a GPU recognized:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```
   If `nvidia-smi` is not installed or doesn’t detect a GPU, you likely have a driver/GPU mismatch.
2. If you intend to run on a CPU-only system (no NVIDIA GPU):
   - Remove `--cuda-offload` and `--gpu=0` from the command, or
   - Install the appropriate NVIDIA drivers and ensure the GPU is recognized.

---

## 5. Verify the HQPlayer Configuration is Valid

Your systemd unit passes a lot of parameters:

```bash
--oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long
--filter=poly-sinc-ext3
--modulator=asdm7ecv3
--rate=DSD512
--dither=TPDF
--integrator=fir2
--conversion=xfi
--directsdm
--fft=32768
...
```

Some of these might conflict with your DAC’s capabilities or each other. Typical safe ones for many DSD setups might be something like:

- `--filter=poly-sinc-ext3`
- `--modulator=asl5` (just for testing)
- `--rate=DSD256` (if DSD512 is too high for your hardware)
- Omit `--oversampling=...` if you’re not certain.

**Try a simpler set** of HQPlayer options manually to see if it starts, then add the extra arguments one by one.

---

## 6. Confirm “NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6” and “Red” are Valid

You have:

```
--backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6"
--device "Red"
```

If you’re running a standard HQPlayer setup with NAA, the default backend is often just `NetworkAudioAdapter` (IPv4) or “Auto”. If your system truly needs IPv6 only, that’s fine—just confirm the NAA device **“Red”** is indeed available and advertising on IPv6.

- If “Red” only advertises on IPv4, specifying `NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6` might cause issues.
- **Try** `--backend="NetworkAudioAdapter"` (no IPv6 suffix) and see if that helps.

Also, confirm the exact name is “Red” (case sensitive). If your actual NAA device name has extra spaces or punctuation, HQPlayer will exit if it can’t find a matching device.

---

## 7. Check Environment Variables

You set:

```ini
Environment=HQPLAYER_HOME=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-ashwin"
```

- Verify the directory **`/tmp/runtime-ashwin`** exists and has correct permissions for user `ashwin`.
  ```bash
  ls -ld /tmp/runtime-ashwin
  ```
- If it doesn’t exist, create it:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /tmp/runtime-ashwin
  sudo chown ashwin:ashwin /tmp/runtime-ashwin
  chmod 700 /tmp/runtime-ashwin
  ```
- Some applications rely on `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` for DBus or X11 sessions, so it must be properly owned by the user.

---

## 8. Test Without Systemd

If everything works **when run manually** but fails under systemd, it’s often due to environment or permission differences. For instance:

- **Systemd** might not have a valid user session for `ashwin`.
- The **user** might require `loginctl enable-linger ashwin` so that user services can remain alive without an active login session.
- **`xvfb-run`** might behave differently under systemd, especially if no “real” environment or `$DISPLAY` is set.

You can try a **user service** approach with `systemctl --user` instead of a system-wide service. That ensures it runs under your actual user login environment.

---

## 9. Increase Logging and Look at `journalctl`

Since you set:

```ini
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
```

You can see HQPlayer’s stderr/stdout in the systemd journal. After a fail:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
```

Look for the actual HQPlayer error message. If it’s not present, the problem might be from `xvfb-run` failing or some environment setup that occurs **before** HQPlayer is launched.

---

## 10. Summary of What to Try

1. **Run HQPlayer manually** as `ashwin` using the exact systemd command (with all arguments).
2. **Check** whether `cuda-offload` or the specific filters/modulators are causing an immediate crash.
3. **Simplify**: remove `--oversampling=...`, remove `--cuda-offload`, use a simpler modulator, etc. See if you can get it to start.
4. **Check** your device backend: maybe remove the `IPv6` suffix or confirm your “Red” device is reachable.
5. **Look** at `/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log` for errors.
6. **Examine** `journalctl` logs carefully for anything about Xvfb, GPU drivers, or missing dependencies.

Once you’ve confirmed a stable command-line run, integrate those known-good arguments (and environment) back into the systemd service. That typically resolves the exit code 255 problem.

This error:

```
Failed to open or create config: clXmlElement::GetAttr(): parse error, missing '='
exception: main(): clXmlElement::GetAttr(): parse error, missing '='
```

indicates that HQPlayer encountered an **invalid or corrupt XML** entry while trying to read or write its configuration file. HQPlayer Desktop stores its config as an XML file—often named **`hqplayer.xml`**—and if it has malformed lines (e.g. mismatched tags, missing quotes), HQPlayer will throw this parsing error.

Below are steps to troubleshoot and fix the config file issue.

---

## 1. Locate HQPlayer’s Config File

By default (especially on Linux), HQPlayer Desktop looks for `hqplayer.xml` in **`~/.hqplayer/`**. You can confirm this path because you set:

```
Environment=HQPLAYER_HOME=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer
```

So it’s likely in:

```
/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/hqplayer.xml
```

---

## 2. Temporarily Rename or Remove the Config File

A quick way to see if the config file is the culprit:

1. **Stop** HQPlayer (if running).
2. **Rename** your config file (so you don’t lose it permanently):
   ```bash
   mv /home/ashwin/.hqplayer/hqplayer.xml /home/ashwin/.hqplayer/hqplayer.xml.bak
   ```
3. **Re-run** your HQPlayer command:
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop ... (all your arguments)
   ```
   HQPlayer should recreate a fresh `hqplayer.xml` automatically if it doesn’t find one.

If HQPlayer starts **without** the parse error now, you’ve confirmed the old config file was malformed. You can then manually compare the fresh config with your old backup to see what got corrupted.

---

## 3. Inspect/Repair the Config File

If you wish to preserve custom settings from your old config:

1. **Open** `/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/hqplayer.xml.bak` in a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, etc.).
2. Look for any suspicious lines where an XML element or attribute is missing an `=` or has mismatched quotes. For instance:
   ```xml
   <Device name "Red" backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" ...>
   ```
   Notice if you see `name "Red"` with no equals sign, that’s invalid XML. It should be:
   ```xml
   <Device name="Red" backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" ...>
   ```
3. Fix the malformed line(s), save, and rename it back to `hqplayer.xml`.

Sometimes leftover references to older devices (like “ropieee \[RoPieeeXL]”) are stored incorrectly and break XML syntax if not quoted properly.

---

## 4. Check Command-Line Arguments vs. Config

HQPlayer merges the config file **and** your command-line arguments. If the config has a device or filter that conflicts with your CLI parameters, HQPlayer might try to reconcile them and fail. Once you have a clean config, verify there isn’t a conflict such as:

- A mismatch in backend names (e.g., `'NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6'` vs `'NetworkAudioAdapter'`).
- Wrong device name (`"Red"` vs actual name in config).
- Leftover references to old adapters with invalid characters.

---

## 5. Rerun HQPlayer and Verify

After you’ve either **reset** or **repaired** the config file, try again:

```bash
/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
    --oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long \
    --filter=poly-sinc-ext3 \
    ...
    --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
```

If HQPlayer starts **without** the parse error, you’re good to go.

---

### Additional Tips

1. **Check the HQPlayer Log**\
   You’re already using:
   ```
   --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
   ```
   Peek inside this file for details if you see other errors.

2. **Minimal Starting Command**\
   If you suspect conflicting parameters, try a minimal command (e.g., no `--cuda-offload`, simpler filter/modulator) to confirm HQPlayer can start. Then re-add your advanced options.

3. **Keep a Backup**\
   Once you have a stable `hqplayer.xml`, it’s a good idea to keep it backed up in case of future corruption.

By removing or fixing the malformed **`hqplayer.xml`** in your `~/.hqplayer/` directory, you should eliminate the **“parse error, missing '='”** issue and allow HQPlayer to launch properly under your chosen parameters.

HQPlayer Desktop’s error:

```
Failed to open or create config: clXmlElement::GetAttr(): parse error, missing '='
exception: main(): clXmlElement::GetAttr(): parse error, missing '='
```

means there’s **malformed XML** in one of HQPlayer’s XML files. However, you noticed there is **no** `hqplayer.xml` in `~/.hqplayer`. Instead, you have:

```
auth.xml  
current.m3u8  
hqplayer5desktop-key.xml  
library.xml  
settings.xml
```

Most likely, **`settings.xml`** is HQPlayer’s main config file on your system—i.e., the file HQPlayer is actually trying to parse or write to. A similar name like `hqplayer.xml` is common on some versions, but here it appears HQPlayer is using `settings.xml` for storing preferences.

---

## 1. Check Which File is Corrupted

Since HQPlayer is throwing a parsing error, it’s almost certainly within one of these XML files. The prime suspects are:

- **`settings.xml`** (most likely the main HQPlayer config)
- **`library.xml`** (stores track library info; could also be corrupted if you have any unusual text in paths)

**`auth.xml`** and **`hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`** typically store license info, while **`current.m3u8`** is just a playlist file. Corruption in those is possible but less common.

### Easiest Next Step: Temporarily Move Files

You can rename (or move) each file one-by-one to see which triggers the error. For example, start with `settings.xml`:

```bash
cd ~/.hqplayer
mv settings.xml settings.xml.bak
```

Then run HQPlayer again:

```bash
/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop [all your CLI arguments]
```

- If the **parse error goes away**, you’ve found the culprit—`settings.xml` was malformed.
- If it **still** complains, repeat with `library.xml` or the others.

Whichever file you rename that finally eliminates the parse error is the one containing invalid XML.

---

## 2. Inspect the Problem File

Once you know which file triggers the error (most likely `settings.xml`), open it in a text editor:

```bash
micro ~/.hqplayer/settings.xml
```

Look for suspicious attributes or tags missing an `=` sign. For example, a valid XML attribute should look like:

```xml
<Device name="Red" backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" something="value">
```

A malformed attribute might look like:

```xml
<Device name "Red" backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" ...>
```

*(no equals sign after `name`)*

or:

```xml
<Device name="Red" backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6 >
```

*(missing closing quote)*

Correct any invalid lines. Save and exit. Then rename it back to its original filename if you had moved it:

```bash
mv settings.xml.bak settings.xml
```

---

## 3. Re-Run HQPlayer

After fixing or removing the corrupted file, run your HQPlayer command again:

```bash
/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
    --oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long \
    --filter=poly-sinc-ext3 \
    --modulator=asdm7ecv3 \
    --rate=DSD512 \
    --dither=TPDF \
    --integrator=fir2 \
    --conversion=xfi \
    --directsdm \
    --cuda-offload \
    --gpu=0 \
    --fft=32768 \
    --backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" \
    --device "Red" \
    --sdp=DoP \
    --adaptive-rate \
    --buffer-time=50 \
    --48kdsd \
    --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
```

If HQPlayer now starts **without** the parse error, the fix is complete. If you still see the same error, continue checking the remaining XML files.

---

## 4. Summary

- HQPlayer is definitely trying to read or create an XML file that’s malformed.
- On your setup, `~/.hqplayer/settings.xml` is the most likely culprit, rather than `hqplayer.xml`.
- Rename or remove each XML file in `~/.hqplayer` until the error disappears, then open the problematic file in a text editor and look for an attribute missing `=` or missing quotes.
- Once fixed, HQPlayer should run normally.

By pinpointing and correcting the malformed XML lines, you’ll eliminate the **“parse error, missing '='”** and get HQPlayer Desktop running properly on your Ubuntu server.

1. Introduction
HQPlayer is a high quality audio player for Windows Vista, Windows 7/8/8.1/10 and
Linux and Mac OS X. HQPlayer also features several user selectable high quality
resamplers as well as user selectable dither/noise shaping algorithms and delta-sigma
modulators.
Some of the more affordable sound cards and D/A converters have suboptimal digital
and analog filters, while still having support for higher sampling rates. Effect of this can
reduced by applying high quality upsampling in software before feeding the signal to
the audio hardware at higher rate. This moves some of the artifacts of the suboptimal
hardware to higher frequencies, away from the audible band. Many of the home-
theater amplifiers also re-sample internally to 48, 96 or 192 kHz, with the HQPlayer,
these can be fed at the native rate.
Most modern D/A converters are delta-sigma type. Built-in delta-sigma modulator of
HQPlayer allows using DSD-capable converters with this native data format, in many
cases bypassing lot of DSP processing in these converters and allowing more direct
data path to the conversion stage.
Resampling also allows playback for high resolution audio files on hardware capable
of only lower sampling rates or bit depths. For lower bit depth playback, high quality
dither or noise shaping can be employed.
HQPlayer also includes a convolution engine for applying digital room correction filters
or other kinds of equalization.
These features ensure the best possible audio quality with the available audio
hardware.
1.1. DSDIFF and DSF playback
Playback of DSDIFF and DSF files is supported. In case hardware and drivers support
ASIO DSD -mode, or one of the “PCM packed” modes, these files can be played back
in native format.
For devices capable of only PCM input, PDM (pulse density modulation) content of
these files is converted to 176.4 (64fs), 352.8 (128fs) or 705.6 kHz (256fs) PCM (pulse
code modulation) format for playback through PCM audio hardware.The playback rate
of DSDIFF and DSF files can be further altered by using resampling to chosen rate.
Thus, playback rates from 32 to 1536 kHz are possible. Used bit depth is always
maximum supported by the playback hardware.
Also multichannel loudspeaker delay- and level-processing is supported in both
converted and native modes.

1.2. Network Audio
Network Audio is a way to have remote audio adapters and DACs integrated
seamlessly with the player application. All the audio processing is performed at the
player application side, and then streamed asynchronously over the network for
reproduction.

2. Main screen
When the application is first started up, main screen is displayed.
User interface also supports standard multimedia keys and equivalent remote controls.
It also features two modes, the traditional desktop application mode shown above, and
new touch-optimized full-screen mode available through the right-most button in the
toolbar.
Tracks, directory trees and playlist files can be added to the current playlist by drag-
and-drop from outside of the application.
Note! In case you experience clicks/pops between DSDIFF/DSF tracks, creating a
playlist for the tracks enables special code to reset the modulation state. Playback
won't be gapless in this mode.
2.1. Transport selection (library)
Transport is the playback source location. It lists all configured FLAC-, DSDIFF-,
DSF- , WAV- and AIFF- file paths as well as playlist files and a CD-drive. For file path,
each sub-directory is expected to be an album consisting of files in one of the
supported formats. Transports are structured in a tree model in Artist / Performer /
Album / Song order.
Selecting a new transport represents similar action as changing a CD in physical drive.

Main screen
7 / 38
When album node is expanded, tracks of the album are listed. Selecting tracks
switches transport into playlist mode, where individual tracks (from same or different
album) can be added.
2.2. Transport search and filters
There is one search entry and three filter entries (Artist, Performer and Album). Search
entry is typical case insensitive “contains” search. Except for search strings with length
equal to, or shorter than three characters, in which case search criteria is “begins
with”.
Transport view can also be filtered by entering filtering rules. Rules can be in
traditional “wildcard” ('*') format, or in Perl-style regular expression format, when
prefixed with '#'.
2.3. Song display
For CD, this field is used only to display track numbers.
When playing back FLAC-files, metadata is shown. If metadata is not available a file
name is shown. For DSDIFF-, DSF-, WAV- and AIFF- files, file name is displayed.
2.4. Track display
Current track number and total number of tracks on a transport is shown on this
display. For CD, this is the normal track number. For FLAC/DSDIFF/DSF/WAV/AIFF-
files, track numbering is constructed per directory basis based on file name sorting
order. For preferred order, file names should begin with correct zero-prefixed track
number.
2.5. Time display
This display shows the selected time information. By default, it is the time from
beginning of the track. Other possible values are time from end of the track and total
time from end of the album (transport).
2.6. Mode display
Selected time display mode is indicated here. Shown values are “time” for the time
from beginning of the track, “remain” for the time from end of the track and “total
remain” for the time from end of the album. Display mode can be changed by clicking
this box.
2.7. Convolution
When this button is depressed, convolution processing is completely bypassed. When
this button is pressed, convolution engine is active and the configured impulse
responses will be used to process the signal before resampling. Convolution can be
enabled and disabled during the playback.
Note! When source material sampling rate differs from the impulse sampling rate,
impulse responses will be scaled to the source material's sampling rate. This can have
a huge impact on CPU load, and with large impulse responses will require significant
amount of CPU processing power.

2.8. Phase inversion
Absolute phase can be inverted in cases where volume control is available.
2.9. Repeat and Random playback
Current tracklist/playlist can be repeated and played back in random order. It is also
possible to repeat a single track.
2.10. Playlist management
Clicking the “Clear playlist” -button clears the internal playlist transport. If some other
transport (such as album) is active, this doesn't have visible effect until new playlist is
created. Playlist can be also loaded and saved using corresponding buttons.
When other transport than playlist is selected, playlist is still in memory. Transport can
be switched back to the playlist by clicking the “Activate playlist” button.
Playlist playback of DSDIFF/DSF files is not gapless, but a special code is enabled in
order to avoid clicks/pops between unrelated tracks.
2.11. Allow remote control from network
When this button is pressed, remote control of the player is allowed also from network.
When the button is depressed, remote control is only allowed from the same machine.
2.12. Filter / oversampling selection
This selection can be used to switch between resampling filters. This selection has an
impact on available hardware sampling rates. This selection cannot be changed during
playback. Different variants of “poly-sinc” are the most recommended by the author.

Filter Description
none No sample rate conversion happens. Only sample depth is
changed as needed.
IIR This is analog-sounding filter, especially suitable for recordings
containing strong transients, long post-echo is a side effect (not
usually audible due to masking). A really steep IIR filter is used.
This filter type is similar to analog filters and has no pre-echo, but
has a long post-echo. Small amount of pass-band ripple is also
present. IIR filter is applied in time-domain. This filter performs
better when resampling with only factor of 2 or 3 and somewhat
worse at factor of 4 and higher.
FIR Typical “oversampling” digital filter, generally suitable for most
uses (slight pre- and post-echo), but best on classical music
recorded in a real world acoustic environment such as concert hall.
This is the most ordinary filter type, usually present in hardware.
This filter is applied in time-domain. It has average amount of pre-
and post-echo.
asymFIR Asymmetric FIR, good for jazz/blues, and other music containing
transients recorded in real world acoustic environment. Otherwise
same as FIR, but with a shorter pre-echo and longer post-echo.
Modifies phase response, but not as much as minimum phase
FIR.
minphaseFIR Minimum phase FIR, good for pop/rock/electronic music containing
strong transients such as drums and percussion and where
recording is made in a studio using multi-track equipment. No pre-
echo, but somewhat long post-echo.
FFT Technically good steep “brickwall” filter, but might have some side
effects (pre-echo) on material containing strong transients. This
filter is similar to FIR, but it is applied in frequency-domain and is
quite efficient from performance point of view while having rather
long impulse response.
poly-sinc /
better space
Linear phase polyphase sinc filter. Very high quality linear phase
resampling filter, can perform most of the typical conversion ratios.
Good phase response, but has some amount of pre-echo. See
“FIR” for further details.
poly-sinc-mp /
better transients
Minimum phase polyphase sinc filter, otherwise similar to poly-
sinc. Altered phase response, but no pre-echo. See
“minphaseFIR” for further details.
poly-sinc-shrt Otherwise similar as poly-sinc, but shorter pre- and post-echos at
the expense of filtering quality (not as sharp roll-off and reduced
stop-band attenuation).
poly-sinc-shrt-mp Minimum phase variant of poly-sinc-shrt. Otherwise similar to poly-
sinc-mp, but shorter post-echo. Most optimal transient
reproduction.

10 / 38
Filter Description
poly-sinc-hb Linear-phase polyphase half-band filter with steep cut-off and high
attenuation.
poly-sinc-ext Linear phase polyphase sinc filter with sharper cut-off and
somewhat lower stop-band attenuation, while being roughly equal
length to poly-sinc.
poly-sinc-mqa Linear phase polyphase sinc filter optimized for playing back MQA
encoded content in order to clean up noise added by the MQA
encoding.
sinc This is a special type of filter, slightly similar to FIR, but with a
possibility of asynchronous operation for conversions from any
rate to any other rate. Computationally heavy and not
recommended.
polynomial-1 Polynomial interpolation. Most natural polynomial interpolation for
audio. Only two samples of pre- and post-echo. Frequency
response rolls off slowly in the top octave. Poor stop-band
rejection and will thus leak fairly high amount of ultrasonic noise.
These type of filters are sometimes referred to as “non-ringing” by
some manufacturers. Not recommended.
polynomial-2 Similar to polynomial-1, but higher stop-band rejection with the
expense of being a bit less natural for audio. Not recommended.
minringFIR Minimum ringing FIR. Uses special algorithm to create a linear-
phase filter that minimizes amount of ringing while providing better
frequency-response and attenuation than polynomial interpolators.
Performance and ringing is between polynomial and poly-sinc-
short.
closed-form Closed form interpolation with high number of taps.
closed-form-fast Closed form interpolation with lower CPU load, but also lower
precision. Output precision tuned to match about 24-bit PCM.
*-2s Two stage oversampling. First stage rate conversion is performed
by at least by factor of 8 using the selected algorithm. And further
converted to the final rate using algorithm optimized for conversion
of content that has already been processed to at least 8x rate. This
lowers the overall CPU load, while preserving the same
conversion quality. Especially useful for highest output rates.
2.13. Noise-shaping / dither / modulator selection
This selection can be used to switch between different word-length reduction
algorithms. Especially important when playback hardware supports less than 24 bits.
This selection cannot be changed during playback.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
11 / 38
NS/Dither Description
none No noise-shaping or dithering, only rounding. Mostly suitable for 32-bit
output hardware where quantization error is buried in thermal noise. Not
recommended.
NS1 Simple first order noise-shaping. Sample values are rounded and the
quantization error is shaped such way that the error energy is pushed to
the higher frequencies. Suitable mostly for 176.4/192 kHz upsampling.
NS4 Fourth order noise-shaping. Similar in shape as “shaped” dither.
Suitable for all rates equal or higher than 88.2 kHz.
NS5 Fifth order noise-shaping. Fairly aggressive noise-shaping designed for
8x and 16x rates (352.8/384/705.6/768 kHz). Not recommended for
rates below 192 kHz. (Especially good for PCM1704 at those highest
rates.)
NS9 Ninth order noise-shaping. Very aggressive noise-shaping designed
especially for 4x rates (176.4/192 kHz) and recommended for these
rates. (Especially good for older 16-bit 4x rate capable multibit-DACs
like TDA154x etc.)
RPDF Rectangular Probability Density Function. White noise dither.
Computationally light weight, but only suitable for 24-bit or higher
output hardware.
TPDF Triangular Probability Density Function. This is the industry standard
simple dither mechanism. Suitable for any rate and recommended if
playback rate is 44.1/48 kHz. Recommended for general purpose use.
Gauss1 Gaussian Probability Density Function. High quality flat frequency dither
recommended for rates at or below 96 kHz where noise-shaping is not
suitable.
shaped Shaped dither. Noise used in this dither has shaped frequency
distribution to lower audibility of the dither noise. Suitable for playback
rates of 88.2/96 kHz, or higher.
DSD5 Rate adaptive fifth order one-bit delta-sigma modulator.
DSD5v2 Revised fifth order one-bit delta-sigma modulator.
DSD7 Seventh order one-bit delta-sigma modulator.
DSD5v2
256+fs
Revised fifth order one-bit delta-sigma modulator optimized for rates >=
10.24 MHz.
DSD7
256+fs
Seventh order one-bit delta-sigma modulator optimized for rates >=
10.24 MHz.
ASDM5 Adaptive fifth order one-bit delta-sigma modulator.
ASDM7 Adaptive seventh order one-bit delta-sigma modulator.
Note! Use of “NS1” with equipment sensitive to ultrasonic noise is not recommended.

2.14. Sample rate selection
This selection can be used to switch between supported hardware sample rates.
Available choices depend on selected transport and resampling filter type. This
selection cannot be changed during playback. Auto setting automatically selects a
highest rate that is equal or less than the limit set in the Settings dialog and is possible
using the chosen filter.
Note! When “none” is selected as resampling algorithm, output sampling rate is
adjusted based on source file's sampling rate.
2.15. PCM / SDM (DSD) output mode selection
In case playback hardware supports both modes, the mode can be changed using this
selection. In PCM mode, when source content is DSD it will be converted to PCM for
playback. In SDM mode, when source content is PCM it will be converted to SDM for
playback. Auto setting automatically switches between PCM and SDM modes to
match the source content type.
Note! High oversampling ratios can generate high inter-sample overs. Overloading the
delta-sigma modulator in SDM mode will also cause audible noises. It is therefore
recommended to keep software volume at max -3 dB setting or lower when using
PCM to SDM conversion to avoid overloads. Maximum modulation depth is monitored
and when necessary limited to 50% as per SACD specification.
2.16. Volume control
Playback volume can be controlled through volume multimedia keys or remote control,
or by operating this adjustment wheel. Selected dither/noise-shaping algorithm has
significant impact on quality of this adjustment.
When using any resampling, maximum recommended volume level is -2 dBFS to
avoid inter-sample overloads, and in case material contains digital clipping/limiting.
Note! Never use software based volume control as sole mean for adjusting volume.
Always limit the maximum possible volume to reasonable levels by using suitable
hardware adjustment!
2.17. Position/seek bar
Shows relative playback position of a currently playing song while also allowing seeks
to arbitrary position within the song.

3. Full-screen mode
When full-screen button is clicked in the main window toolbar, following kind of screen
is shown either in maximized window or in full-screen, depending on corresponding
setting in Settings-dialog.
This display is optimized for touch-screens, but can be also used with a mouse or
other suitable pointing device.
Cover art of the current track is shown as a background image, when available. If track
doesn't have embedded cover art, album/folder cover image is used instead. If no
cover image is available, default background image is shown. Information about
current track is shown in the top left corner of the screen.
Track-listing is shown in top-right corner of the screen with high-light of current track
and possibility to directly select a track. Volume adjustment is in the lower right corner
and can be adjusted by dragging from the the adjustment either up or down. Volume
can be also operated using a mouse wheel when mouse pointer is within the control.
3.1. Switching views
Full-screen mode has three parallel views in horizontal direction. The view described
above is the middle one. Views can be switched by flick gestures to left or right.
3.2. Album selection view
On the left, there is an album selection view with cover flow and search on the top of
the screen. When the search entry at the top of the screen is clicked or tapped, virtual

keyboard is shown (Windows only). Search strings of three characters or less are
considered “begins with” matches. Search strings longer than three are considered
“contains” matches. Search strings with either or both '*' and '?' wildcard characters
are handled as normal wildcard matches, where '*' means any number of any
character and '?' means any single character. Clicking or tapping an album will select it
for playback and return the view back to the normal middle-view.
3.3. Playlist edit view
On the right, there is a playlist edit view shown below.
Going from left to right, there's an artist selection column, album selection column and
track selection column. The right-most column is the current playlist. Tracks can be
added or removed using the + and – keys below. Tracks can be also reordered by
using the up/down arrow buttons. Or the playlist can be cleared using the C button.

To edit library, open the “File” menu and select “Library...”. Following dialog will be
shown.
List shown on the left is the list of album locations available on the transport selector.
Each path is intended to represent an album consisting of files of same number of
channels.
To remove an album from the listing, select the album path and click “Remove” button.
Once you are done with the editing, select either “OK” to save your changes or
“Cancel” to discard the changes.
It is also possible to edit album metadata by double-clicking a cell.
To add a specific album path, click “Add...” to browse and select an album folder you
wish to add and click “OK”. Now the path to the selected file will be added to the list of
available albums. To add an entire directory tree, click “Add tree...” to browse and
select base directory of the tree you wish to add and click “OK”. All the nodes of the
directory tree with recognized content will be added to the list of available albums and
new/changed cover art is recognized. Already known entries are automatically ignored
(except for added folder cover art). Select “Structure only” to extract metadata solely
from the directory tree structure instead of metadata embedded in files.
Metadata for each path is loaded when available. If metadata is not available within
the file, it is constructed from the full file path, assumed of being in format
Artist/Album/Song.

5. Settings
To change program's device settings, open the “File” menu and select “Settings...”.
Following dialog will be shown.
Content of the device selection depends on the selected back-end.
For WASAPI and CoreAudio driver types, used audio endpoint (device) can be
selected by using the “Device” selection which lists all the available audio endpoints in
addition to the default endpoint, which is the one selected in Windows Control Panel or
OS X Audio MIDI Setup for the default audio output.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
Settings dialog
18 / 38
For ASIO driver type, used audio device can be selected by using the “Device”
selection which lists all the available ASIO devices. “Ch. offset” can be used to select
the channel which is considered to be the first in channel mapping (0-based).
For Network Audio driver type, list of remote audio devices is shown on the “Device”
selection.
On Linux, ALSA audio endpoint (device) can be selected by using the “Device”
selection which lists all the available hardware audio endpoints.
On Windows, drive letter for the CD drive can be changed from the “CD drive”
selection. On Linux, device node for the CD drive can be entered.
Default audio processing settings can be changed from the “PCM Defaults” and “SDM
Defaults” boxes.
Number of output channels can be chosen from “Channels” selection, possible
choices are “2” for stereo, “5.1” for normal multichannel, “7.1” for extended
multichannel and “16”/”32” primarily for complex matrix processing cases.
DSD content can be transferred to the audio device by packing it into suitable PCM
container, select “DoP” to use the DoP v1.1 standard. The “2wire” setting enables
dual-wire channel bonding to achieve 2x higher sampling rates for both PCM and
DoP-based DSD on those DACs that support this feature. For ASIO on Windows,
“AltDSD” changes units of the DSD sample from bit to a byte, use this only when
experiencing incorrect DSD playback, incorrectly enabling this will make the
application crash (currently known devices to need this setting are Playback Designs
and Merging).
Channel mapping is following (regardless of driver type):
0. Front Left
1. Front Right
2. Front Center
3. Low Frequency (LFE)
4. Back Left
5. Back Right
6. Side Left
7. Side Right
Length of the hardware audio buffer (in milliseconds) can be changed by using “Buffer
time” selection. It is recommended to use “Driver default”, unless audio drop-outs are
experienced. When “Driver default” is used, the audio driver defines length of the
buffer. In case of WASAPI, this is more or less fixed value. In case of ASIO, this can be
usually controlled through ASIO control panel, which can be launched by selecting
“ASIO Control Panel...” from the “Tools” menu. Values between 10 and 100 ms are
most recommended.
It is also possible to configure adjustment range of the volume control. When both
values are set to zero (0), volume control is bypassed completely.
When DAC with other bit depth than 24-bit is connected to a unidirectional interface
like S/PDIF or AES/EBU it is recommended to select correct number of bits from the
“DAC bits” selection. If measurement results for the DAC are available, a value
corresponding to linear range of the DAC can be used.

Pipeline SDM increases parallelization of PCM-to-SDM conversion. Mostly useful on
computers with multiple slower (real) CPU cores or when using CUDA offload. Since
this parallelization increases processing overhead, it will increase total CPU time
consumption. “CUDA offload” can utilize nVidia GPU to partially offload the processing
from CPU to GPU. CUDA offload requires nVidia GPU with minimum Compute
Capability level 3.0, 2 GB of graphics RAM and official nVidia drivers. When offload is
enabled and suitable GPU is available, message about the offload is briefly shown at
the beginning of playback of each track.
Auto rate family, when used in conjunction with Auto output rate setting in main
window makes automatic output rate selection pick sampling rates that are multiples of
the source content sampling rate.
Full screen mode setting makes the full screen touch-oriented interface truly full
screen instead of maximized window.
To save the settings, click the “OK” button and to discard any setting changes click the
“Cancel” button.
Note! Using one of the heavy algorithms for upsampling multichannel audio files can
require significant amount of CPU processing power!
Note! Do NOT select anything other than “None” as SDM packing, unless you are
sure your hardware supports the particular special packed mode!
5.1. DSDIFF/DSF settings
Settings for the PDM → PCM conversion process can be changed through a settings
dialog available from the “File” menu by selecting “DSDIFF/DSF settings...”. Following
dialog will be displayed.
DirectSDM setting disables all processing when source file is DSD content and output
format is SDM to a DSD-device.
DSDIFF or DSF file should typically have 6 dB of headroom on the signal level. By
selecting “6 dB gain” check box, 6 decibels of gain is applied, removing this headroom
from the converted signal. This way the normal playback level reaches that of CD,
FLAC, WAV or AIFF. However, this may cause digital clipping with some source
material and thus use of 6 dB gain is not recommended!
Type of conversion can be selected from the “Conversion type” drop list. Following
conversion types are supported.

Conversion type Description
traditional Traditional recursive conversion algorithm.
Minimizes amount of ringing by using slow
roll-off filters.
single-steep Single-pass conversion algorithm with steep
cut-off.
single-short Single-pass conversion algorithm with
normal cut-off. Optimized tradeoff between
ringing and wide frequency response.
poly-lin Linear-phase single-pass conversion
algorithm.
poly-mp Minimum-phase single-pass conversion
algorithm.
poly-short-lin Linear-phase slow roll-off single-pass
conversion algorithm. Recommended.
poly-short-mp Minimum-phase slow roll-off single-pass
conversion algorithm.
Different types of noise filters are provided. These reduce amount of ultrasonic noise
present in the source data. Standard filtering leaves low level of ultrasonic noise.
Some loudspeakers with tweeters of low power handling capability can be sensitive to
this noise, especially when higher listening volumes are used. Also some poorly
designed amplifiers can misbehave in presence of such ultrasonic content. Therefore
more aggressive noise filters can be selected by using “Noise filter” drop list. These
filters will also limit bandwidth available for the audio content. Following filters are
supported.
When playback rate of DSDIFF or DSF is 88.2/96 kHz, use of extra noise filtering in
addition to “standard” is less important, since most of the noise will be cut out. When
playback rate of DSDIFF or DSF is 44.1/48 kHz, extra noise filtering in addition to
“standard” is not needed and will actually just reduce playback quality.

Noise filter Description
standard Standard noise filter will be applied.
Recommended.
low Similar to standard, but has lower corner
frequency and results in almost flat noise
profile in ultrasonic range. Recommended.
sac Sliding average converter.
wec Weighted element converter.
slow-lin Slow roll-off linear-phase filter.
slow-mp Slow roll-off minimum-phase filter.
fast-lin Fast roll-off linear-phase filter.
fast-mp Fast roll-off minimum-phase filter.
There are three types of delta-sigma integrators available.
Integrator Description
IIR Normal IIR type integrator structure.
FIR Weighted FIR type integrator structure.
CIC Cascade comb type integrator structure.
5.2. Speaker setup
For multichannel playback, speaker distances and playback levels can be configured
using speaker setup dialog. This dialog can be reached by opening “Tools” menu and
selecting “Speaker Setup...”.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
22 / 38
In this dialog, distance to each individual speaker can be set in centimeters. Playback
of the speaker can be set using the volume slider and unit shown in upper right corner
is in dB.
Pink noise test tone can be played by selecting the “Test tone” box. When the box is
checked, tone will be played in all channels, thus making it easy to adjust all levels in
such way that the they sound equal. When the box is grayed, tone will be played one
channel at the time in rotating manner, making it easy to adjust all levels using an SPL
meter.
Multichannel delay processing is done in target sampling rate. This increases
processing accuracy as the output sampling rate is increased.
5.3. Network Audio Adapter naming
Network Audio Adapters can be assigned a non-default name using Tools / Network
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
Speaker setup dialog
23 / 38
naming menu selection and following dialog.
When this dialog is opened, a NAA discovery is run and a list of discovered adapters
appears in a few seconds. Selecting an entry from the list displays the selected
address and it's associated name on the right. Name can be modified and sent to the
device by clicking “Set” button. After each modification a re-discovery is run.
This way, different names can be assigned for different adapters for example for multi-
room use, so that different adapters can be recognized and found even if their
assigned IP address changes over time.
5.4. ASIO channel mapping
When using ASIO, in addition to just using default channel mapping it is also possible
to assign custom channel mappings. This can be done by selecting “ASIO Channel
Mappings...” from the “Tools” menu.

6. Convolution engine
Convolution engine can be configured through the “Convolution” menu and selecting
“Engine setup...”.
Following dialog will be shown.
When “Engine enabled” option is checked, convolution engine is enabled at the
application level and enabled by default at the startup time. Enable this selection only
after selecting suitable impulse response files and if you are certain that your files
contain intended impulse response data.
Convolution algorithm can be changed from the “Convolution engine” selection. There
are two possibilities, “overlap-add” consumes less CPU power and is recommended.
Another alternative is “overlap-save” which consumes more CPU power.
To select impulse response files, “Browse...” button can be used. A normal file
selection dialog will be shown. After a file is selected, some preliminary checks for the
suitability is done and an error message is displayed in case of incorrect file details.
Left and right channels can have independent files.
When an impulse response file is selected through “Browse...”, it's estimated gain
function is calculated and displayed in “IR gain” box. This can help choosing suitable
value for “Gain compensation”. Also the default convolution engine can be selected.
When positive gain compensation is chosen, it is applied as negative gain when
convolution is disabled from the main screen. This makes it easier to compare impact
of the particular convolution setup.
When provided impulse response is lower sampling rate than source material, it's high
frequency response can be expanded to cover the new bandwidth by selecting
“Expand HF” setting.
Clicking “OK” will save the setting to the configuration file and the settings are ready
for use.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
Convolution engine setup dialog
26 / 38
Convolution engine requires impulse responses to be mono RIFF (WAV) format files.
If some of the channels don't need processing, or are not used, clearing the filename
will disable convolution engine for those channels.
For example popular Room EQ Wizard can export suitable impulse responses after
designing for “Generic” equalizer by selecting File → Export → Filters Impulse
Response as WAV. Expert users can also use open source DRC tool for designing
even suitable full-band correction filters.
Note! Use of long convolution filters for all eight channels of audio for hires audio files
will need substantial amount of CPU processing power!

7. Matrix processing
Matrix processing offers a way to copy, route, filter and mix down channels with
specified gains. Matrix processing consists of 32 virtual channels.
For example the configuration shown above can be used to mix down 5.0/5.1 channel
material to stereo.
The “Source Ch” specifies the channel which is used as a source for the virtual
channel. “Gain” is overall gain applied for the virtual channel and “Mix Ch” is the
logical output channel. When multiple virtual channels have the same target channel,
outputs of the virtual channels are mixed together to the target output channel.
At the moment “Process” can define external filter impulse response WAV file that is
applied as part of the processing.
Note! Convolution and Matrix processing are mutually exclusive, so only one of the
two should be enabled at a time. However, the Convolution setup dialog can be used
for easier selection of filter files for the first eight channels.

8. Registering your copy
Activation code can be entered by opening “Help” menu and choosing “Register...”.
Dialog will appear asking for the code. If your code was shipped with a name, fill also
name field, otherwise leave it empty.
Code can be also entered after, or close to trial period closing when a dialog asking for
the code appears at startup time.
Note! Especially on Windows 7 it may be necessary to start the application as
Administrator in order to successfully store the registration code. To do it, right-click on
the application's Start-menu entry and select “Run as administrator” from the menu.
8.1. Registering Linux / Mac OS X version

9. Troubleshooting
This chapter explains some known workarounds and things which you can try, in case
of problems.
9.1. Reporting bugs
In case you discover bugs, please enable log file functionality from the settings dialog,
try to reproduce the bug and send the log file together with a screen shot (PrtScn
button) to our support email address support@signalyst.com . On Windows the log file
can be found from \Users\<username>\AppData\Local\HQPlayer directory of the
system drive. You may need to complete this path on the address bar of the Windows
Explorer as these are not shown by default. On Linux and Mac OS X, log file can be
found from the hidden ~/.hqplayer directory, where “~” denotes user's home directory.
The log file is called HQPlayer.log.
9.2. Sound problems with USB audio device
Default buffer size for USB audio devices is fairly small (10 ms) in Windows. This
sometimes causes various audio playback issues when some other process is loading
the system. If you experience such problems, increase size of the audio buffer by
changing the “Buffer time” setting in Settings-dialog. Good starting point is 100 ms.
9.3. Generic
You might want to check that your selected sound device has exclusive mode enabled
in endpoint properties.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
30 / 38
With some buggy drivers it might also be necessary to change default format to match
the sample rate you are trying to use with HQPlayer.
9.4. Channel mapping
Please note, that depending on sound device, channel mappings may have playback-
software independent implications. For example some cards perform internal downmix
of multichannel playback depending on speaker layout configured in their respective
control panels.
Here is example of speaker setup found in Windows Vista in Control Panel → Sound /
Playback → Configure.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
Endpoint properties dialog
31 / 38
And here is example of Creative Audio Console speaker setup.
Copyright © 2008-2016 Jussi Laako / Signalyst. All rights reserved.
Windows Vista Speaker Setup dialog
32 / 38
When using ASIO channel mapping with Creative driver, it is advisable to select
maximum number of channels (7.1 Speakers) here in order to avoid conflicts between
downmixing done by the Creative hardware/drivers and channel mapping / speaker
setup processing done by the HQPlayer.
9.5. No rates available
In some cases, rate selection may stay empty. This means that there are no suitable
hardware sampling rates available for selected source material and resampling filter
combination. In this case, try selecting different resampling filter, such as “sinc”,
“minphase-sinc” or “none”.
9.6. Known workarounds
E-MU 0202 USB, 0404 USB and Tracker Pre USB
Driver may use fixed rate which can be changed from the E-MU control panel (icon
can be found from the system tray).

Usually selecting 44.1 kHz rate and internal sync source allows rate control by the
software. If not, sample rate needs to be changed from this control panel before
clicking “Play” in HQPlayer, otherwise starting the device may fail. If this happens
anyway, you can click “Stop”, then correct the sampling rate in E-MU control panel and
click “Play” again.

In your latest logs, systemd is rejecting several lines in your **hqplayer5desktop.service** file:

```
Jan 15 10:47:06 ubuntu-server systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service:43: Failed to parse CPU affinity '#'
Jan 15 10:47:06 ubuntu-server systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service:44: Failed to parse nice priority '-10                           # ...'
Jan 15 10:47:06 ubuntu-server systemd[1]: ...
```

All those errors are because **systemd** interprets anything **after** the first space on the same line as part of the value. The `# comment` at the end of each line isn’t treated as a comment—systemd thinks it’s part of the configuration directive itself, which leads to a “Failed to parse” error. Essentially, inline comments break certain directives in systemd unit files unless they’re separated by a semicolon or put on an entirely separate line.

Below is how to fix each problematic line:

---

## 1. Remove or Relocate Trailing Comments

Instead of writing:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0-15                   # Dedicate the first 16 CPU cores
Nice=-10                           # Prioritize HQPlayer over other processes
IOSchedulingClass=realtime         # Set I/O scheduling to realtime
IOSchedulingPriority=0             # Maximize I/O performance
TasksMax=infinity                  # Allow unlimited tasks for this service
MemoryHigh=infinity                # No memory cap for HQPlayer
CPUQuota=100%                      # Allow HQPlayer to fully utilize ...
```

…you should either:

1. **Put the comment on a separate line** (recommended), for example:
   ```ini
   CPUAffinity=0-15
   # Dedicate the first 16 CPU cores

   Nice=-10
   # Prioritize HQPlayer over other processes

   IOSchedulingClass=realtime
   # Set I/O scheduling to realtime
   ...
   ```

2. **Or** remove the comment entirely if you don’t need it in the service file.

Systemd **does** allow inline comments if you separate them with a semicolon at the end, for example:

```ini
Nice=-10 ; # Prioritize HQPlayer over other processes
```

…but in many cases it’s cleaner just to put your comment on its own line above or below the directive.

---

## 2. Verify the CPUAffinity Directive

Systemd **usually** wants CPU affinity as a space-separated list (like `CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 ... 15`), **not** a dash range. Depending on your systemd version, `CPUAffinity=0-15` might work, or it might fail. If systemd is parsing the dash literally, you’ll want:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

This sets affinity for cores 0 through 15. If your systemd version supports a dash notation, it can sometimes accept `0-15`; otherwise, explicitly listing each CPU core is the safe bet.

---

## 3. Double-Check Other Advanced Directives

- **TasksMax=infinity**: This is valid on newer systemd versions, but older versions might fail. If it does fail, you can try a large numeric value (e.g. `TasksMax=65535`).
- **MemoryHigh=infinity**: Also a newer systemd directive. If your distro’s systemd is older, it may not support “infinity.” Check `man systemd.resource-control` on your distro to confirm.
- **CPUQuota=100%**: Usually valid on modern systemd. If it complains, you can omit CPUQuota entirely or specify a numeric limit (e.g. `CPUQuota=200%` for double CPU time).

---

## 4. Example Corrected Service File Snippet

Here’s a cleaned-up snippet:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
    --oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long \
    --filter=poly-sinc-ext3 \
    ...
    --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log

WorkingDirectory=/home/ashwin
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
TimeoutStartSec=60
Restart=on-failure

# CPU and scheduling optimizations
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
# Dedicates the first 16 CPU cores

Nice=-10
# Prioritize HQPlayer over other processes

IOSchedulingClass=realtime
# Set I/O scheduling to realtime

IOSchedulingPriority=0
# Maximize I/O performance

TasksMax=infinity
# Or remove/limit if older systemd doesn't parse "infinity"

MemoryHigh=infinity
# If unsupported, remove or specify a numeric limit

CPUQuota=100%
# Let HQPlayer fully utilize available CPU resources

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This format puts each directive on its own line with any comment **on a separate line**. That ensures systemd doesn’t parse the comment as part of the value.

---

### Recap

- **Inline `#`** in systemd unit lines cause parse failures unless carefully handled.
- **Move comments** to their own lines or remove them entirely to avoid confusion.
- **Check** systemd version if `0-15` or `infinity` is not recognized.

After making these changes, **reload** the systemd daemon and **start** your service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start hqplayer5desktop.service
sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
```

You should then see HQPlayer Desktop start without the “Failed to parse” errors.

**Short Answer:** Yes, that service file looks correct overall. You’ve removed or relocated the comments that caused parse errors, and each directive is on its own line. As long as your systemd version supports `TasksMax=infinity`, `MemoryHigh=infinity`, and `CPUQuota=100%`, you should be good to go.

Below are a few final checks you might consider:

---

## 1. Confirm Systemd Directives Are Supported

- **`TasksMax=infinity`** and **`MemoryHigh=infinity`**
  - Older systemd versions (prior to \~v232) may not support “infinity” for these directives. If you see warnings about them in `journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service`, replace `infinity` with a large numeric value, for example:
    ```ini
    TasksMax=65535
    MemoryHigh=100G
    ```
    Or remove them entirely if not needed.

- **`CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 ... 15`**
  - This works on modern systemd (it sets CPU affinity to cores 0 through 15). If your systemd is older and complains, you can remove the line or specify fewer cores.
  - Also confirm you indeed have at least 16 logical cores (0 through 15).

- **`CPUQuota=100%`**
  - Tells systemd that this service can use up to 100% of **one** CPU core in total. If you want it to utilize all cores fully, you can set:
    ```ini
    CPUQuota=100%
    ```
    or
    ```ini
    CPUQuota=0
    ```
    (which often means “no quota/limit” in newer systemd).
  - If you want HQPlayer to potentially use more than one core’s worth of CPU time, you can increase to e.g. `CPUQuota=200%` or higher.

---

## 2. (Optional) Specify a Service `Type`

By default, systemd uses `Type=simple`. HQPlayer Desktop is a typical foreground process, so `Type=simple` is fine. If you want to be explicit, you can add:

```ini
[Service]
Type=simple
...
```

This ensures systemd knows HQPlayer does not fork and runs directly in the foreground.

---

## 3. Check Xvfb Dependencies and Environment

Because you’re launching HQPlayer Desktop via:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop ...
```

make sure:

1. **`xvfb`** (the package) is installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install xvfb
   ```
2. **`/tmp/runtime-ashwin`** exists (if needed) and has the right permissions for user `ashwin`. For instance:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /tmp/runtime-ashwin
   sudo chown ashwin:ashwin /tmp/runtime-ashwin
   chmod 700 /tmp/runtime-ashwin
   ```
   If HQPlayer works fine without that directory, it’s probably okay—some versions of HQPlayer may not strictly need `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` set.

---

## 4. Test and Verify

1. **Reload systemd** to pick up the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
2. **Enable** the service if you want HQPlayer to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
3. **Start** it:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
4. **Check status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
   journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
   ```
   Look for any new warnings or errors. If it’s active/running, your service file is good to go.

---

### Conclusion

Your updated service file is valid. You’ve separated out the inline comments to avoid parse errors, and your ExecStart line is intact. Just watch for potential version-specific systemd limitations on directives like `TasksMax=infinity` or `MemoryHigh=infinity`. Otherwise, you should be all set to run HQPlayer Desktop as a systemd service.

Yes, that looks good! You’ve correctly placed each directive on its own line (with no trailing inline comments to break systemd’s parsing) and changed `--device "Red"` to `--device="Red"` (which is generally safer for command-line parsing).

Here are a few small additional notes:

1. **Weird Characters in Comment**\
   In the line:
   ```ini
   # CPU and scheduling optimiza∂œtions
   ```
   you have two stray characters (`∂` and `œ`). Systemd will ignore them since it’s a comment, but you might want to remove or replace them to keep the service file tidy:
   ```ini
   # CPU and scheduling optimizations
   ```

2. **Systemd Directives Compatibility**
   - As before, make sure your systemd supports `TasksMax=infinity`, `MemoryHigh=infinity`, and `CPUQuota=100%`.
   - If you see any warnings in `journalctl`, you can replace them with numeric values or remove them.

3. **Confirm You Have 16 Logical Cores**\
   `CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15` is valid only if your system has at least 16 logical cores. If your CPU is smaller, you’ll want to adjust accordingly.

Otherwise, it all looks correct. Once you’ve made that small comment fix (optional), just do:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable hqplayer5desktop.service
sudo systemctl start hqplayer5desktop.service
```

… and verify the status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
```

If HQPlayer starts without errors, your service is good to go!

Systemd Directives Compatibility

    As before, make sure your systemd supports TasksMax=infinity, MemoryHigh=infinity, and CPUQuota=100%.
    If you see any warnings in journalctl, you can replace them with numeric values or remove them.

Confirm You Have 16 Logical Cores
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 is valid only if your system has at least 16 logical cores. If your CPU is smaller, you’ll want to adjust accordingly.

how can i verify the number of cores available?

Below are the typical ways to verify both the systemd directives compatibility and the number of available CPU cores.

---

## 1. **Check Systemd Version and Logs**

### 1.1 Check Your Systemd Version

Systemd directives like `TasksMax=infinity`, `MemoryHigh=infinity`, and `CPUQuota=100%` generally require systemd **v232** or later. You can see your systemd version by running:

```bash
systemd --version
```

or:

```bash
systemctl --version
```

You’ll get output like:

```
systemd 245 (245.4-4ubuntu3.11)
+PAM +AUDIT +SELINUX +IMA +APPARMOR ...
```

As long as the systemd version is **232** or newer, it *should* understand “infinity” for TasksMax and MemoryHigh. If you have an older version (e.g., 229), you may see warnings in logs, and you’ll likely need to replace `infinity` with numeric values.

### 1.2 Check Journals for Warnings

After you start or restart your HQPlayer service, run:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
```

or:

```bash
journalctl -xeu hqplayer5desktop.service
```

Look for messages like “Invalid argument for TasksMax” or “Failed to parse memory limit.” If you see any such warnings, you’ll know you need to revise the directives to numeric values or remove them.

---

## 2. **Confirm You Have 16 Logical CPU Cores**

Your service file sets:

```
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

That indicates you want HQPlayer to run on logical CPU cores 0 through 15 (i.e., a total of 16).

### 2.1 Use `nproc`

A simple way to check the number of CPU cores (threads) recognized by the system:

```bash
nproc
```

If this returns **16**, then you indeed have 16 logical cores and can leave `CPUAffinity=0 ... 15` as is.

### 2.2 Use `lscpu`

Another command that gives you detailed CPU info is:

```bash
lscpu
```

You’ll see lines like:

```
CPU(s):                16
Thread(s) per core:    2
Core(s) per socket:    8
Socket(s):             1
```

- **CPU(s)**: is your total number of logical (virtual) cores.
- **Core(s) per socket** \* `Thread(s) per core` = total CPU(s) if it’s a single-socket system.

### 2.3 Use `/proc/cpuinfo`

You can also do:

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep '^processor' | wc -l
```

This will list all the `processor` lines in `/proc/cpuinfo`—one per logical core—and then count them (`wc -l`).

---

## 3. **Adjusting If Fewer Than 16 Cores**

If `nproc` or `lscpu` shows, for example, only **8** logical cores, then you’d want to change:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

Or remove it entirely if you don’t specifically need CPU pinning (often leaving it off is fine unless you want strict scheduling).

---

### Quick Summary

1. **Check Systemd Version**:
   - `systemd --version`
   - If **>=232**, `TasksMax=infinity` etc. are fine. Otherwise, swap them for numeric values.

2. **Look at Logs**:
   - `journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b`
   - Any warnings about “Invalid argument” or “Failed to parse” means you should remove or replace them.

3. **Confirm Core Count**:
   - `nproc` or `lscpu` → If it’s **16**, `CPUAffinity=0 ... 15` is valid. If it’s less, adjust.

Doing the above will ensure your HQPlayer systemd service file is fully compatible with your system’s hardware and software environment.

From the logs, the main issue is that **systemd is interpreting the comment text at the end of each directive line** as part of the value. Even though you’re on **systemd 255**, which supports `infinity` for `TasksMax` and `MemoryHigh`, systemd stops parsing the line at the first space and then hits the `#` (and extra text) as if it’s part of the directive. That’s why you see “Failed to parse” or “ignoring” for each line.

You also discovered you have **32 logical CPU cores** (`CPU(s): 32`), so if you want to bind HQPlayer to all cores, you’d use `CPUAffinity=0 1 2 ... 31`.

Below is how to fix your service file so systemd no longer complains:

---

## 1. Remove or Move Trailing Comments

Right now, you likely have lines like:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15    # Dedicates the first 16 CPU cores
```

Systemd tries to parse `# Dedicates ...` as part of the value for `CPUAffinity`. Instead, **place your comment on a separate line**:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
# Dedicates the first 16 CPU cores
```

Similarly for `TasksMax`, `MemoryHigh`, `CPUQuota`, etc.:

```ini
TasksMax=infinity
# Or remove/limit if older systemd doesn't parse "infinity"

MemoryHigh=infinity
# If unsupported, remove or specify a numeric limit

CPUQuota=100%
# Let HQPlayer fully utilize available CPU resources
```

---

## 2. Update CPUAffinity for All 32 Logical Cores (Optional)

If you really want HQPlayer to see **all 32 cores**, change:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

to:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
```

That way you’re using all threads of your **Ryzen 9 7950X3D**. Or, if you don’t care about explicit CPU pinning, you can just remove `CPUAffinity=...` altogether.

---

## 3. Example of a Cleaned-Up Service File

Here’s a minimal version without trailing comments and with 32-core affinity:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HQPlayer Desktop Service
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ashwin
Environment=HQPLAYER_HOME=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-ashwin"

ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
    --oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long \
    --filter=poly-sinc-ext3 \
    --modulator=asdm7ecv3 \
    --rate=DSD512 \
    --dither=TPDF \
    --integrator=fir2 \
    --conversion=xfi \
    --directsdm \
    --cuda-offload \
    --gpu=0 \
    --fft=32768 \
    --backend="NetworkAudioAdapter IPv6" \
    --device="Red" \
    --sdp=DoP \
    --adaptive-rate \
    --buffer-time=50 \
    --48kdsd \
    --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log

WorkingDirectory=/home/ashwin
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
TimeoutStartSec=60
Restart=on-failure

CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
# This pins HQPlayer to all 32 logical CPU cores

Nice=-10
IOSchedulingClass=realtime
IOSchedulingPriority=0
TasksMax=infinity
MemoryHigh=infinity
CPUQuota=100%

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- If you prefer to keep small descriptive comments, just put them **on their own lines**.
- Because you’re running systemd **255**, `infinity` and `CPUQuota=100%` should be fine. If you **still** see warnings about them (unlikely at that version), you can remove them or replace `infinity` with large numeric values (e.g., `65535` for `TasksMax`).

---

## 4. Reload and Check Logs

After editing, do:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart hqplayer5desktop.service
sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
```

Check the logs again:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
```

You should no longer see “Failed to parse CPU affinity” or “Invalid maximum tasks value” errors. If everything started up fine, you’re set.

---

### Recap

- **Remove trailing `# comments`** from the same line as your directives.
- **Use the entire range of cores if you want** (0–31) for your 32-thread CPU.
- **Systemd 255** supports `TasksMax=infinity` and `MemoryHigh=infinity`, so you can keep them unless logs still complain.

With those changes, your HQPlayer Desktop service should start without parse errors, pinned to all 32 CPU cores if desired. Enjoy your high-powered upsampling!

From these logs, there are two main issues:

1. **Systemd is rejecting each directive because of trailing comments**
2. **OpenMP (OMP) is complaining that CPU IDs above 15 are “invalid”** for the HQPlayer process

Let’s unpack both.

---

## 1. Systemd Rejecting the Service File Directives

In your logs, lines like this appear:

```
Jan 15 10:47:06 ubuntu-server systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service:43: Failed to parse CPU affinity '#'
...
Jan 15 10:47:06 ubuntu-server systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service:47: Invalid maximum tasks value 'infinity                  # ...', ignoring: Invalid argument
...
Jan 15 10:47:06 ubuntu-server systemd[1]: /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service:49: Invalid CPU quota '100%                      # ...', ignoring.
```

These happen because systemd **does not** treat `#` as a comment **once it’s on the same line** as a directive.\
For example, a line like:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  # 16 CPU cores
```

…causes systemd to parse `# 16 CPU cores` as *part of the CPUAffinity value* (which is invalid). The same for `TasksMax=infinity  # My comment` and so forth.

#### **Solution**

**Move the comment onto its own line** or remove it entirely. So instead of:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 ... 15   # Dedicates the first 16 CPU cores
```

…you should have:

```ini
CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 ... 15
# Dedicates the first 16 CPU cores
```

Likewise for `TasksMax=infinity`, `MemoryHigh=infinity`, and `CPUQuota=100%`. Just remove trailing comments, or put them above/below each directive.

---

## 2. OpenMP Complaints About Invalid OS Proc IDs

You see lines like:

```
OMP: Warning #124: Ignoring invalid OS proc ID 16.
OMP: Warning #124: Ignoring invalid OS proc ID 17.
...
OMP: Warning #124: Ignoring invalid OS proc ID 31.
OMP: Warning #125: No valid OS proc IDs specified - not using affinity.
```

This means HQPlayer’s underlying OpenMP library tried to apply thread affinity to CPU IDs `[16..31]` but was told they don’t exist—or at least aren’t valid from its perspective.

### But You Actually Have 32 Cores!

You confirmed:

```
nproc -> 32
lscpu -> CPU(s): 32
```

So from the Linux kernel’s viewpoint, CPU IDs 0–31 definitely exist. However, it’s possible:

1. **HQPlayer** or **xvfb-run** is launched with a restricted cpuset or cgroup that only sees the first 16 cores, so any reference to `CPUAffinity=16..31` is invalid in that namespace.
2. **Systemd** is ignoring or failing the `CPUAffinity` lines, so the environment might be mismatched.
3. **OpenMP** is discovering some conflict or mismatch in how the CPU affinity is being pinned vs. the actual available hardware threads.

In short, the OMP library sees references to CPU IDs 16+ but cannot set affinity to them. Possibly the HQPlayer process is pinned to the first 16 cores only, or xvfb-run is limiting the environment to 16 PIDs.

#### **How To Fix**

- Make sure the final, *parsed* version of your systemd unit has a correct `CPUAffinity=0 1 2 ... 31` line.
- Confirm that no other cgroup or cpuset constraints (like from Docker or LXC or some HPC job manager) are limiting HQPlayer to 0–15.
- If you still get OMP warnings, you might remove the `CPUAffinity=...` line altogether—letting the OS schedule HQPlayer across all cores on its own.

Often it’s simpler to let the Linux scheduler handle CPU distribution unless you specifically *need* custom pinning.

---

## Putting It All Together

1. **Remove trailing comments** from the same line as your directives. For instance:

   ```ini
   [Service]
   User=ashwin
   Type=simple

   ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
       --oversampling=... \
       ...

   WorkingDirectory=/home/ashwin
   StandardOutput=journal
   StandardError=journal
   TimeoutStartSec=60
   Restart=on-failure

   CPUAffinity=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
   # We have 32 logical cores, so we specify all from 0..31

   Nice=-10
   IOSchedulingClass=realtime
   IOSchedulingPriority=0
   TasksMax=infinity
   MemoryHigh=infinity
   CPUQuota=100%

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. **Reload systemd**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart hqplayer5desktop
   sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop
   ```

3. **Check logs** to see if systemd is still complaining about “Failed to parse.” If not, you’ve resolved the parse issues.

4. **If OMP warnings persist** that it can’t set affinity on cores 16–31, try:
   - Removing `CPUAffinity=...` entirely and see if OMP stops complaining.
   - Checking if `xvfb-run` or another cgroup setting might be limiting the CPU set. You could try skipping `xvfb-run` temporarily (just as a test in a shell) to see if the error disappears:
     ```bash
     /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop --oversampling=... ...
     ```
     (Of course, HQPlayer Desktop wants an X server, so that’s just to confirm if the OMP errors go away.)

As long as HQPlayer is running, you can probably ignore the OMP warnings if performance is fine, but typically you’d want it pinned to all cores if you’re aiming for maximum DSP throughput.

---

### In Summary

- **Remove trailing comments** to resolve the systemd “Failed to parse” lines.
- **Use or remove `CPUAffinity`** carefully. If you truly want all 32 cores, set it to `0..31`. If OMP still complains, consider letting the OS schedule HQPlayer across all cores by removing the affinity line altogether.
- After that, the “Invalid OS proc ID” warnings should either stop or can be safely ignored if everything runs normally.

To make sure you’re looking at **current** logs (and not old ones), here are a few tips:

---

### 1. Check Only Logs from the Current Boot

Use the **`-b`** (boot) flag with `journalctl` to view messages from the **current** boot. For example:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b
```

This shows only the entries since your system last booted. If you see the old messages again in that output, then they really are from **this** boot. Otherwise, you’ll only see the current, fresh logs.

You can also **limit** how many lines you see, for instance:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager -n 50
```

This shows the **latest 50 lines** from the current boot, without paging.

---

### 2. Follow Logs Live

If you want to watch logs appear in real-time, use **`-f`** (follow):

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b -f
```

Then, when you (re)start HQPlayer or it logs something new, you’ll see it show up immediately.

---

### 3. Confirm the Time of Each Log Entry

Each log line will have a timestamp (date/time). Double-check the timestamps to confirm whether the message is truly from the current session, or from a previous day/boot.

---

### 4. Optional: Filter by a Time Range

You can also explicitly specify a start time. For example:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service --since "2025-01-15 10:00:00"
```

This ensures you only see logs since a specific date/time. Combine with `-b` if needed:

```bash
journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --since "2025-01-15 10:00:00"
```

---

### 5. (Rarely Needed) Clearing Old Logs

If you really want to ensure all old logs are gone (e.g., for a clean slate) you can manually **clear the journal**. This is typically **not** recommended in a production system, but if you decide to do so:

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1s
```

This will remove all journal entries older than 1 second—which effectively clears everything. Then, any new logs are guaranteed fresh.

---

## Summary

- **Use `journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b`** to see **only** the current boot’s logs.
- Check **timestamps** on each log line to confirm they’re recent.
- **Follow logs** in real time with `-f` to ensure you only see new, “live” output.

This way, you can confirm whether or not older messages still apply to your current HQPlayer setup. If they don’t show up under `-b`, they were from a previous boot.

It looks like your HQPlayer service is **starting and stopping** cleanly without showing any new “Failed to parse” or “ignoring: Invalid argument” lines. The timestamps are also consistent with your current session, so these logs likely **reflect the current (latest) state** of HQPlayer Desktop on your system.

Here’s how you can confirm things further:

1. **No Old Error Messages**
   - The log lines here show the service is **stopping** and **starting**—both times it’s “Started hqplayer5desktop.service” successfully.
   - No “Failed to parse” or “Invalid argument” messages appear in these entries, which indicates the systemd directives are likely **all valid now**.

2. **Double-Check Timestamp**
   - The logs show events at `Jan 15 11:06:14`. If that corresponds to your current local date/time (or close enough, given any system clock differences), then these are indeed **the latest** logs.

3. **Confirm Behavior with Real-Time Logs**
   - Because you used `-f` (follow), everything after you ran `systemctl start hqplayer5desktop.service` is displayed in real-time. If any new error popped up, you’d see it immediately.

4. **(Optional) Check HQPlayer’s Logfile**
   - You also defined `--logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log` in your ExecStart line. Look there if you suspect HQPlayer might be logging additional errors or warnings about audio devices or other issues.

5. **Verifying Everything Is Active**
   - You can run:
     ```bash
     systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
     ```
     to confirm the service’s current status (should say “active (running)” if it’s up).

Since you’re not seeing any new parse errors, it looks like your current HQPlayer Desktop systemd unit file is **correctly configured**, and you’re reviewing **fresh** logs from the current boot/session. If HQPlayer runs as intended and you don’t see warnings, then everything is in good shape.

Everything looks **great**:

- Your **service file** is cleanly parsed by systemd (no more “Failed to parse” or “Invalid argument” lines).
- The **status** output shows **“active (running)”** with no warnings or errors.
- HQPlayer **logs** look normal (“active locale: C.UTF-8,” etc.).

Because your file has `CPUAffinity=0 1 2 ... 31`, HQPlayer is now being pinned to all **32** logical CPU cores. Systemd **accepted** this configuration, which means your updated service file is working as intended.

If you’d like to confirm HQPlayer actually **sees** all 32 cores, you can:

1. **Check HQPlayer logs** (the one specified by `--logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log`) for any mention of thread/CPU binding. If all is well, it should run without complaining about invalid cores.

2. **Look at real-time usage**:
   - You can run a tool like **`htop`** or **`top`** and see if the HQPlayer process spawns threads across all cores.

3. **Verify affinity** with `taskset`:
   ```bash
   # Find the main PID of hqplayer5desktop
   systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service

   # Suppose the main PID is 12056
   taskset -cp 12056
   ```
   That will tell you which cores the process is allowed to run on. You should see `0-31`.

If everything lines up and there are **no** warnings in the HQPlayer or systemd logs, you’re good to go!

Below is an **example** of how you might merge your **CLI** parameters into a new `settings.xml` file for HQPlayer Desktop. However, **be aware** that HQPlayer Desktop doesn’t officially provide a direct mechanism to “export” the exact CLI parameters into `settings.xml`. Instead, HQPlayer typically merges its XML-based config with any parameters passed on the command line at **runtime**.

Because of that, you have two main approaches:

1. **(Recommended)** Launch HQPlayer Desktop **once** with all your CLI arguments, then open its GUI (or let it run), and close it cleanly. HQPlayer **may** write any recognized settings to `~/.hqplayer/settings.xml` (or sometimes `hqplayer.xml`). Not all settings that exist on the CLI necessarily have an equivalent XML tag—some are just run-time overrides.

2. **Manually edit** `settings.xml` yourself to **approximate** the CLI settings. This is less precise and requires mapping each CLI parameter to the correct XML attribute or node, which can be a bit trial-and-error.

---

## 1. Basic Reference: HQPlayer’s XML Structure

Typically, `settings.xml` (or `hqplayer.xml`) looks like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<hqplayer>
    <engine
        type="alsa"
        fft_size="512"
        samplerate="384000"
        channels="2"
        volume_min="-60"
        volume_limit="0"
        ...
    >
        <defaults
            bitrate="11289600"
            dither="5"
            filter="40"
            filter1x="37"
            modulator="17"
            oversampling="43"
            oversampling1x="40"
            ...
        />
    </engine>
    <log enabled="0"/>
</hqplayer>
```

- The parent `<engine>` tag sets broad/driver-level parameters like `type="alsa"`, `channels="2"`, etc.
- The nested `<defaults>` tag sets your “PCM Defaults” and “SDM Defaults” (like filter choice, dither, modulator, oversampling, etc.).
- A `<log>` element can appear for your log settings.

**But** you will see numeric codes for filters, dither, modulator, etc. (e.g., `filter="40"`). HQPlayer’s internal numbering scheme doesn’t map 1:1 to string names like `poly-sinc-ext3`. If you load the GUI and choose “poly-sinc-ext3,” “asdm7ecv3,” etc., HQPlayer writes the **internal** numeric IDs for them into `settings.xml`.

---

## 2. Example “Best Guess” settings.xml

Below is an **illustrative** file that might reflect your CLI arguments. **Note** that these numeric codes (like `"40"`, `"31"`, etc.) are not official—**you’d need to confirm them** by manually setting each parameter in the GUI and then seeing what gets written. Some folks figure out the codes by trial and error, or by reading HQPlayer logs.

**So treat this as a template** you can tweak:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<hqplayer>
    <!-- HQPlayer engine settings -->
    <engine
        type="NetworkAudioAdapter"       <!-- backend="NetworkAudioAdapter" -->
        channels="2"                     <!-- stereo -->
        samplerate="22579200"           <!-- DSD512 = 44.1k x 512 = 22579200  -->
        fft_size="32768"                <!-- --fft=32768 -->
        adaptive_rate="1"               <!-- --adaptive-rate -->
        volume_min="-60"
        volume_limit="0"
        cd_drive="/dev/cdrom"
        auto_family="0"
    >
        <!-- The <defaults> block typically represents PCM & SDM default settings -->
        <defaults
            oversampling="??"    <!-- numeric ID for poly-sinc-gauss-long -->
            oversampling1x="??"  <!-- often same or alternative filter at 1x rates -->
            filter="??"          <!-- numeric ID for poly-sinc-ext3 -->
            modulator="??"       <!-- numeric for asdm7ecv3 -->
            dither="??"          <!-- numeric for TPDF -->
            integrator="??"      <!-- numeric if HQPlayer uses integrator codes -->
            bitrate="22579200"   <!-- DSD512 rate in bits/s ? (some HQPlayer versions do it differently) -->
            conversion="??"      <!-- might store the xfi conversion type as a numeric ID -->
            directsdm="1"        <!-- --directsdm -->
        />
    </engine>

    <!-- This sets up logging. If you want logging=1, specify enabled="1", and optional file= attribute. -->
    <log enabled="1" file="/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log"/>
</hqplayer>
```

A few notes:

- **`type="NetworkAudioAdapter"`** loosely corresponds to your `--backend="NetworkAudioAdapter"` CLI argument.
- **`samplerate="22579200"`** is typical for DSD512 (512 × 44.1 kHz).
- **`adaptive_rate="1"`** is the HQPlayer “Adaptive Output Rate” setting.
- The **`oversampling=??`** etc. attributes require numeric values. HQPlayer stores these as enumerations rather than text.

Again, this is only an **illustration**. The numeric IDs vary by HQPlayer version, so the simplest method to get them correct is:

1. **Launch HQPlayer** in GUI mode.
2. **Set** the parameters you want (e.g., poly-sinc-gauss-long, asdm7ecv3, etc.).
3. **Exit** HQPlayer.
4. Look at the updated `settings.xml` or `hqplayer.xml`.
5. **Copy** that file if you want to replicate the settings on a headless box.

---

## 3. Let HQPlayer Merge CLI and XML

When you run HQPlayer with both an XML config **and** CLI arguments, HQPlayer **overrides** the XML with CLI arguments. That means if `settings.xml` says “modulator=ASDM5” but your CLI says `--modulator=asdm7ecv3`, you’ll end up with `asdm7ecv3` at runtime.

Hence, if your end goal is to never supply CLI parameters again and have HQPlayer **only** read from a single XML file, you must ensure the XML is correct for every setting. Then start HQPlayer **without** the extra CLI arguments—just `hqplayer5desktop` (and maybe minimal arguments like logging or Xvfb if you want headless operation).

---

## 4. If You Want an Auto-Generated File

As mentioned, the best approach is:

1. Start HQPlayer Desktop *with your desired CLI arguments* on a machine where you can run the GUI.
2. Open HQPlayer’s Settings, confirm it lists the correct filter (`poly-sinc-ext3`), modulator (`asdm7ecv3`), dither (`TPDF`), etc.
3. Close HQPlayer.
4. Inspect the newly saved `settings.xml` / `hqplayer.xml`.

You’ll see something like (for example):

```xml
<engine ... filter="40" modulator="17" oversampling="43" ...
  <defaults ... />
</engine>
```

Those numeric IDs are how HQPlayer references your chosen options. That’s your “auto-generated” version containing all your chosen parameters.

---

### In Summary

- **HQPlayer** does not provide a straightforward command to “export” all CLI flags into a `settings.xml`.
- **You either** manually create a new `settings.xml` (guessing correct numeric IDs) **or** let HQPlayer’s GUI create/update it when you pick each setting interactively.
- Because you’re currently passing so many advanced CLI arguments, your best bet is to **run HQPlayer in GUI mode once**, set everything, exit, then **copy** the resulting `settings.xml` to your headless environment if that’s your goal.

That’s the most reliable way to get a new `settings.xml` containing the same parameters as your CLI arguments.

Below is an **example** of a revised `settings.xml` that **approximates** your new setup, based on the **old** file you shared plus the **new** command-line arguments (CLI) in your systemd service. Because HQPlayer internally stores things like filters and modulators as **numeric IDs**, you’ll see numeric values in `settings.xml`. Unfortunately, **these IDs can vary** by HQPlayer version, so the file below is necessarily a **best guess**.

> **Note**: The simplest, most reliable way to generate a perfectly accurate XML is to run HQPlayer Desktop with your desired settings **in the GUI** (on any machine), then exit so it writes an updated `settings.xml`. That new file will show the correct numeric codes for each filter, modulator, etc. You can then copy it to your headless server.

---

## 1. Why You See Numeric IDs

HQPlayer’s XML stores many parameters (like `poly-sinc-ext3`, `asdm7ecv3`) as numeric codes. For example, in your old file you might see:

```xml
filter="22" filter1x="37" modulator="16" oversampling="32"
```

These correspond to specific HQPlayer filter/modulator enumerations internally.

Because your new CLI uses:

- `--oversampling=poly-sinc-gauss-long`
- `--filter=poly-sinc-ext3`
- `--modulator=asdm7ecv3`
- `--dither=TPDF`
- `--integrator=fir2`
- `--conversion=xfi`

…you’d likely need the matching numeric IDs for each. **The example below** shows plausible guesses. If HQPlayer complains or loads the “wrong” filter in practice, you’ll know a numeric code is off.

---

## 2. Example Updated `settings.xml`

Here’s a file reflecting:

- **Backend**: `type="network"`, with `address="Red: Combo384 Amanero: USB Audio"`
- **Adaptive rate**: on (`adaptive_rate="1"`)
- **CUDA offload**: on (`cuda="1"`)
- **CUDA device**: 0 (`cuda_dev="0"`)
- **FFT size**: 32768 (`fft_size="32768"`)
- **DirectSDM**: on (`direct_sdm="1"`)
- **DSD 6dB**: off (`dsd_6db="0"`)
- **Oversampling**: poly-sinc-gauss-long (some numeric ID `X1`)
- **Filter** (1x) = poly-sinc-ext3 (some numeric ID `X2`)
- **Modulator** = asdm7ecv3 (some numeric ID `X3`)
- **Dither** = TPDF (often `5` in older versions, but it could differ)
- **Conversion** = xfi (maps to `sdm_conversion="??"`)
- **Rate** = DSD512 → typically `samplerate="22579200"` for 44.1k-based DSD512. Or if you prefer a 48k multiple, it could be `24576000` for 48k-based DSD512.

```

### Key Changes vs. Your Old File:

1. **`type="network"`** remains correct for a NetworkAudioAdapter output.
2. **`fft_size="32768"`** updated from `16384`.
3. **`cuda="1"`** and `cuda_dev="0"` reflect `--cuda-offload --gpu=0`.
4. **`samplerate="22579200"`** indicates DSD512 at 44.1k multiples.
5. The `<network>` block’s `address="Red: Combo384 Amanero: USB Audio"` updates from your CLI’s `--device="Red: Combo384 Amanero: USB Audio"`.
   - If you want IPv6 only, change `ipv6="0"` to `ipv6="1"`.
6. `pack_sdm="1"` often corresponds to sending DSD over DoP (`--sdp=DoP`).
7. `period_time="50"` might reflect `--buffer-time=50`. However, older HQPlayer versions used `period_time` in ms for ALSA, not necessarily for the Network block.

### Numeric IDs (`??`)

Below are guesses or placeholders:

- `oversampling="??"` might be “sinc-l,” “sinc-m,” “poly-sinc-gauss-long,” etc. in HQPlayer’s code.
- `filter="??"` for “poly-sinc-ext3.”
- `modulator="??"` for “asdm7ecv3.”

**Without** a convenient reference table from your exact HQPlayer version, you need to do **one** of:

1. **Trial & Error**: Start HQPlayer with different codes in `settings.xml` until you see the desired filter/modulator in the GUI.
2. **Generate** from HQPlayer GUI: The recommended approach.

---

## 3. Final Tips

1. **Manually Editing**
   - If you just copy-paste the above file, you’ll still see `??` placeholders for numeric codes. You can attempt random numeric IDs if you want. But it’s easier to do approach #2 below.

2. **Generate from the GUI (Best Method)**
   - Launch HQPlayer Desktop in a GUI environment (or with X forwarding) using your **desired** filters, modulator, etc.
   - Close HQPlayer. Then check `~/.hqplayer/settings.xml` or `hqplayer.xml`. **That** file is the correct final version with the numeric codes replaced.
   - Copy that file over to your headless server.

3. **CLI vs. XML**
   - If you keep using the CLI args in your systemd unit, HQPlayer will override some/all of the XML settings at runtime anyway.
   - If you want to rely solely on **`settings.xml`** in the future, remove most of the advanced CLI flags from your ExecStart line, so HQPlayer only uses the XML values.

4. **Check the Logs**
   - If HQPlayer can’t parse or doesn’t like certain numeric IDs, it may log warnings in `HQPlayer5Desktop.log`.
   - Also watch the HQPlayer GUI (if you can open it) to confirm your chosen settings are loaded.

---

### Conclusion

The **example** above shows how you might **update** your old `settings.xml` to reflect new CLI parameters. However, because HQPlayer uses **internal numeric codes** for filters, oversampling, and modulators, you usually want HQPlayer to **generate** the file itself (by selecting each option in the GUI). That’s the most reliable method to ensure the XML is accurate and fully aligns with your new system configuration.

Overall, the structure of that `settings.xml` looks **valid**: it has the usual `<engine>`, `<defaults>`, and `<network>` tags, and the attributes are spelled correctly for a typical HQPlayer configuration file. The real question is whether the **numeric values** (for things like `filter`, `modulator`, `oversampling`) match your intended settings, and whether attributes like `bitrate="24576000"` or `fft_size="16384"` align with your current HQPlayer CLI usage and hardware setup.

Below are a few points to verify:

1. **Bitrate = 24576000**
   - `24576000` corresponds to **48 kHz × 512 = 24.576 MHz** (i.e., DSD512 at a 48 kHz multiple).
   - If your DAC and upsampling chain are using **44.1 kHz multiples** for DSD512, you’d use `22579200` instead. Make sure you actually want the 48k base rate, not 44.1k.

2. **Filter / Oversampling / Modulator Numeric Codes**
   - `filter="22"`, `filter1x="37"`, `oversampling="32"`, `oversampling1x="43"`, `modulator="16"`, etc., are **internal HQPlayer IDs**, not human-readable strings like `poly-sinc-gauss-long` or `asdm7ecv3`.
   - If you originally intended **“poly-sinc-gauss-long + poly-sinc-ext3 + asdm7ecv3”**, confirm these numeric IDs really correspond to those. The simplest way to confirm is:
     1. Launch HQPlayer in a GUI environment.
     2. Select each desired filter/modulator in the GUI.
     3. Exit HQPlayer so it writes out the updated XML.
     4. Compare the numeric IDs HQPlayer wrote to what you have here.

3. **`cuda="1"`, `cuda_cdev="-1"`, `cuda_dev="-1"`**
   - This implies CUDA offloading is **enabled**, but it’s specifying `-1` for the device. Some versions of HQPlayer interpret `-1` as “auto-detect.” If you definitely want GPU #0, sometimes it’s `cuda_dev="0"`.
   - If HQPlayer is truly using your GPU at runtime, you’re good. If you see errors in the log about “no CUDA device found,” you may need to adjust it.

4. **FFT Size = 16384**
   - If your new CLI command sets `--fft=32768`, but your XML is `fft_size="16384"`, note that the CLI argument **overrides** the XML. So if you truly want 32768, you could update the XML to `fft_size="32768"`. Or, if you rely on the command line anyway, leaving it at 16384 is harmless—HQPlayer will just use 32768 from the CLI at runtime.

5. **Volume Limit = -10**
   - `volume_limit="-10"` means HQPlayer’s software volume can go up to **-10 dBFS** at maximum. That’s a moderate safety margin but also lowers your maximum output volume. If that’s intentional, good; otherwise, you might set it to `0` or some other value.

6. **Network Block**
   ```xml
   <network 
       address="Red" 
       any_dsd="1" 
       dac_bits="0" 
       device="hw:CARD=Amanero,DEV=0" 
       dualwire="0" 
       ipv6="0" 
       pack_sdm="1" 
       period_time="0"
   />
   ```
   - If your device name in the new CLI is `--device="Red: Combo384 Amanero: USB Audio"`, but here it’s split across `address="Red"` and `device="hw:CARD=Amanero,DEV=0"`, that’s typically how HQPlayer stores the “NAA device name” vs. the “hardware device behind that NAA.” This might be fine so long as “Red” is your actual NAA endpoint name.
   - `pack_sdm="1"` typically corresponds to DoP packaging if the DAC requires it, which lines up with your CLI’s `--sdp=DoP`.

7. **Adaptive Rate = 1**
   - This matches `--adaptive-rate`. Perfect if you want HQPlayer to use varying output rates that track the source file (helpful for NAA endpoints that support multiple sample rates).

8. **Direct SDM = 1**
   - This matches `--directsdm` (i.e., bypass PCM routines if you’re playing DSD sources).

### Does It “Look Right”?

**Structurally**, yes, it’s a valid HQPlayer XML file. Just keep in mind:

- The **CLI arguments override** some of these settings at runtime.
- The numeric codes for filter/modulator/oversampling might or might **not** match your intended combos unless you verified them in the HQPlayer GUI or logs.
- If your DAC is truly 48k-based for DSD512, `bitrate="24576000"` is correct; if it’s 44.1k-based, switch to `22579200`.
- If you’re happy with the leftover default volume limit, integrator, etc., then you’re all set. If you see mismatch or unexpected behavior, you’ll likely need to tweak these numeric fields until you get the exact filter chain you want.

In short, it **looks** fine for an HQPlayer `settings.xml`, but double-check each numeric code and sample rate to ensure they match your actual hardware and the filters/modulators you intended to use. The best test is to **launch HQPlayer** and confirm in the GUI (or logs) that it’s using the correct parameters.

Below are the **most common reasons** why Roon can’t connect to HQPlayer—even when both run on the **same** machine—and **how to troubleshoot**. Since HQPlayer doesn’t always log a clear message when Roon fails to connect, these steps can help you pinpoint what’s going on.

---

## 1. Confirm HQPlayer is Actually Running and Listening

Roon communicates with HQPlayer via **TCP port 4321** by default (unless you changed it). If HQPlayer is running headless or as a service, you can check:

```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 4321
```

or

```bash
sudo ss -tlnp | grep 4321
```

If HQPlayer is listening on port `0.0.0.0:4321` or `127.0.0.1:4321`, that’s good—meaning it’s ready for connections.

If you **don’t** see `:4321` in the output, HQPlayer may not be fully started or listening for Roon connections. In that case:

1. Check if HQPlayer is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
   or, if you’re running HQPlayer Desktop manually, confirm it’s open and not crashing on startup.

2. Verify that HQPlayer is set to **allow remote control**. In the HQPlayer Desktop GUI, there’s typically an “Allow control from network” checkbox or something similar—**make sure it’s enabled**. If you’re purely headless, confirm the HQPlayer config or CLI does not block external control.

---

## 2. Make Sure Roon is Pointed to `localhost` / 127.0.0.1

When Roon and HQPlayer are on the **same** machine, Roon typically points to HQPlayer via:

```
IP Address / Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 4321
```

or sometimes `localhost:4321`. In **Roon Settings** → **Setup** → **HQPlayer** (or under **Audio** in newer Roon versions), ensure you:

1. **Enable** HQPlayer support.
2. Enter the correct IP/hostname. Typically `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
3. Use the default port **4321** unless HQPlayer is configured differently.

Also confirm you’re not mixing IPv6 vs IPv4. If HQPlayer listens on IPv4 only, set Roon to `127.0.0.1`. If HQPlayer listens on IPv6 only, set Roon to `::1`.

---

## 3. Check for Firewall or SELinux Blockage

Even on a **single** machine, a firewall (e.g., UFW, firewalld, or iptables) can block Roon from talking to HQPlayer’s port 4321. Though loopback traffic is usually allowed, sometimes more restrictive setups block or redirect traffic.

- If you use **UFW**, do:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw status
  ```
  See if port 4321 is allowed.
- If you have **firewalld**:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
  ```
- If SELinux is enforced, check audit logs for denials.

On a typical Ubuntu or Debian system with no custom rules, loopback (127.0.0.1) traffic is unblocked. But if you suspect a firewall, **temporarily disable it** (for testing) or allow port 4321 explicitly.

---

## 4. Verify HQPlayer Settings for Network Control

In **HQPlayer Desktop** or **HQPlayer Embedded**:

1. If you have a GUI, open **File** → **Settings** (or **Preferences**) → **Network** or **General** tab. Look for:
   - “Allow control from network” or “Allow remote control.”
   - “Listen on all interfaces” vs. “Listen on 127.0.0.1 only.”
2. If you run HQPlayer Embedded, check the **Web GUI** under **Network** or **Remote control** section.

Make sure it’s not restricted to a certain interface or set to IPv6 only if you’re using IPv4.

---

## 5. Look at Roon and HQPlayer Logs (Where Available)

### 5.1 Roon Logs

- On Linux, Roon Server logs are typically in:
  ```
  /var/roon/RoonServer/Logs/
  ```
  or in your `~/RoonServer/Logs` directory, depending on your install method.
- Check the latest `RoonServer_log.txt`. Look for lines referencing “HQPlayer” or “Failed to connect to HQPlayer” or anything about `127.0.0.1:4321`.

### 5.2 HQPlayer Logs

- If you used `--logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log`, open that file to see if HQPlayer logs any remote control connection attempts.
- If you see no mention of Roon’s connection, Roon might not even be attempting it (wrong IP or port?).

### 5.3 System Logs

- If HQPlayer is running as a systemd service, you can do:
  ```bash
  journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
  ```
  to see if HQPlayer logs anything about inbound connections or errors.

---

## 6. Try a Direct “Telnet” or “Netcat” Test on Port 4321

You can confirm connectivity using a simple `telnet` or `nc`:

```bash
nc -vz 127.0.0.1 4321
```

- If it says `Connection refused`, HQPlayer is not listening or a firewall is blocking.
- If it says `Connection succeeded`, then HQPlayer is listening. Roon might be misconfigured or something else is wrong.

---

## 7. Confirm the HQPlayer Version Matches Roon’s Requirements

Roon occasionally updates how it communicates with HQPlayer. You generally want:

- HQPlayer **Desktop** 4.x or 5.x, or
- HQPlayer **Embedded** (latest version),
- **Roon** core 2.0 or later.

If you’re running an older HQPlayer release that might not speak the same network protocol Roon expects, you could see connectivity failures. Usually Roon’s logs indicate an incompatible HQPlayer version.

---

## 8. If All Else Fails…

- **Remove** any custom command-line arguments that might block remote control or override network settings. Launch HQPlayer in its simplest form and see if Roon can connect.
- **Reboot** your machine to ensure no leftover processes or hung HQPlayer sessions are interfering.
- **Temporarily disable** your firewall or SELinux.
- If you’re using HQPlayer Embedded, **re-run** the network wizard or do a factory reset from the embedded Web GUI.

---

### Summary

- Make sure HQPlayer is **listening** on `127.0.0.1:4321` (or the IP Roon is using).
- Check **Roon** → **Settings** → **HQPlayer** to confirm it points to the same IP/port.
- Ensure **firewalls** are open for loopback or local traffic on port 4321.
- **Allow control from network** is enabled in HQPlayer.

Once you confirm these, 99% of Roon↔HQPlayer connectivity issues on the same machine are resolved. If you still have trouble, check Roon’s logs in the `Logs/` directory for explicit error messages about the attempted HQPlayer connection.

<time datetime="2025-01-15T19:46:30.943Z" title="1/16/2025, 4:46:30 AM">04:46</time>

Because **nc (netcat) is returning “connection refused” on port 4321**, it means **nothing is actually listening** on that port at the moment—even though HQPlayer is running. For Roon to talk to HQPlayer, HQPlayer must be **actively listening** on TCP port 4321 (default), and **“Allow control from network”** must be enabled in HQPlayer’s settings. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

---

## 1. Confirm HQPlayer Actually Listens on Port 4321

1. **Check with `ss` or `netstat`:**
   ```bash
   ss -tlnp | grep 4321
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep 4321
   ```
   If you don’t see a line like `0.0.0.0:4321` or `127.0.0.1:4321`, HQPlayer isn’t listening on that port.
2. **nc -vz 127.0.0.1 4321** returning “connection refused” confirms there is no listener, or HQPlayer is bound to a different interface/port.

---

## 2. Enable “Allow Control from Network” in HQPlayer

### HQPlayer **Desktop** (GUI)

If you can open the HQPlayer Desktop GUI:

1. Go to **Settings** (or **File** → **Settings** / **Preferences**).
2. Look for a checkbox like **“Allow control from network”** or **“Allow remote control”**.
3. Enable it, then **Apply** or **OK** and restart HQPlayer.

If HQPlayer was previously set to local-only control, it will never open port 4321 to accept Roon connections.

### HQPlayer **Embedded**

If you’re running HQPlayer Embedded:

1. Go to its **Web interface** (usually `http://<HQPlayer-IP>/`).
2. Under **Settings** or **Network** or **Remote control**, enable the remote control or Roon integration.
3. Confirm the control/listening port is **4321** (or match whatever Roon is using).

### CLI Arguments

Some HQPlayer versions have command-line flags for remote control. For instance, older versions had `--allow-net-control` or a variant. Check HQPlayer’s documentation to see if you need to specify a port or enable network control at the CLI.

---

## 3. Verify You’re Using the Correct Host/Port in Roon

In **Roon → Settings → Setup** (or **Audio**, depending on Roon version):

1. **Host**: should be `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` if HQPlayer is on the same machine.
2. **Port**: typically `4321` by default. If you changed HQPlayer’s port, match it here.

---

## 4. Check for Alternate Ports or IPv6 Binding

Sometimes HQPlayer might be bound to IPv6 only (`::1:4321`) and not IPv4. Test:

```bash
nc -vz ::1 4321
```

If that connects, HQPlayer is on IPv6 loopback. In that case, set Roon to `[::1]` or “localhost” but ensure Roon attempts an IPv6 connection.

---

## 5. Firewall or SELinux (Likely Not the Issue Here)

You’ve confirmed **UFW is inactive**, so no firewall is blocking local traffic. You can also do:

```bash
sudo iptables -L
```

to confirm there are no special blocking rules, though typically loopback traffic is allowed.

---

## 6. Double-Check HQPlayer Logs

HQPlayer can log whether it opened a control socket. If you have `--logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log` set, look for lines mentioning:

```
Listening for remote control on ...
```

If HQPlayer doesn’t mention listening for remote control, it’s disabled in the config or CLI.

---

### Summary

- **Connection refused** means HQPlayer **is not** listening on `127.0.0.1:4321`.
- You must **enable network/remote control** within HQPlayer (GUI checkbox or embedded web UI).
- Once HQPlayer is truly listening, `nc -vz 127.0.0.1 4321` should say `Connection succeeded`.
- Then Roon can point to `127.0.0.1:4321` and connect.

Since the firewall is off, the key is making sure HQPlayer actually **opens** port 4321 for remote/loopback control. Once that’s set, Roon will discover or directly connect without issue.

okay I'd like to stop hqplayer from running on boot and remove all other custom configs and start from scratch

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-15T19:52:36.216Z" title="1/16/2025, 4:52:36 AM">04:52</time>

Below is a straightforward way to stop HQPlayer from running automatically at boot, remove all the custom systemd configs, and start from scratch. This assumes you’re running **HQPlayer Desktop** on a Linux system with a **systemd** service unit called `hqplayer5desktop.service`, and your HQPlayer config files live under `~/.hqplayer`.

---

## 1. Stop and Disable the Systemd Service

1. **Stop** the running service immediately:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
2. **Disable** it so it does **not** start on boot anymore:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
3. (Optional) **Remove** or **Rename** the custom systemd unit file if you want it gone completely:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service.bak
   ```
4. **Reload systemd** to clear any references:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

At this point, HQPlayer will **not** run at startup.

---

## 2. Remove or Reset HQPlayer Configuration

HQPlayer typically stores its config files in `~/.hqplayer` (i.e., `/home/<username>/.hqplayer`). Common files include:

- `settings.xml` or `hqplayer.xml` – main config
- `auth.xml`, `hqplayer5desktop-key.xml` – license info
- `library.xml`, `current.m3u8`, etc. – library/playlist items
- `HQPlayer5Desktop.log` – if you used `--logfile=...`

If you truly want a **clean slate**, you can:

1. **Back up** the folder if you might need old configs or license files:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mv .hqplayer .hqplayer.bak
   ```
   This renames it so you can always revert if needed.

2. **Create a fresh** empty directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.hqplayer
   ```
   (Alternatively, leave it uncreated; HQPlayer will create it on first run.)

3. If you have a license file for HQPlayer (like `hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`), you can manually copy it from the backup folder into the new `~/.hqplayer` so HQPlayer remains registered, or re-register later.

Now HQPlayer has **no** prior config, logs, or service references.

---

## 3. (Optional) Uninstall or Reinstall HQPlayer

If you want to **completely** remove HQPlayer from your system (in addition to the config and service file), do one of the following depending on your installation method:

- **Package Manager (.deb/.rpm)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove hqplayer-desktop
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -e hqplayer-desktop
  ```
- **Tarball or manual install**:\
  Simply remove the installed binary (for example, `/usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop`) and any symlinks.

If you just want to keep HQPlayer installed but not auto-starting and not using any old configs, you don’t need to uninstall—just skip this step.

---

## 4. Testing a Fresh Start

1. If you kept HQPlayer installed but cleared config files, **run** HQPlayer manually:
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop
   ```
   or if you have a GUI, launch it from a desktop environment.
2. HQPlayer will create a new config directory `~/.hqplayer/` from scratch.
3. Set up your filters, device, or other preferences again.

No old systemd service or config will interfere.

---

### Summary

1. **Stop** and **disable** the HQPlayer systemd service.
2. **Remove** (or rename) `/etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service`.
3. **Clear** or **rename** `~/.hqplayer/` to remove old config/log files.
4. **(Optional)** uninstall HQPlayer if you want a completely fresh install.

Next time you run HQPlayer (manually or via the GUI), it will start without any custom systemd service or leftover config. You can then re-create a new service file and configuration if you’d like to run HQPlayer automatically again in the future.

It looks like your **`~/.hqplayer`** directory contains a few **standard HQPlayer files** plus one that appears unusual:

1. **`auth.xml`**
   - Typically relates to HQPlayer’s license or authentication.

2. **`current.m3u8`**
   - An HQPlayer playlist file currently in use.

3. **`hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`**
   - Your HQPlayer license key file.

4. **`library.xml`**
   - HQPlayer’s library data (lists of albums/tracks, metadata, etc.).

5. **`settings.xml`**
   - HQPlayer’s main configuration file (filters, oversampling, device settings, etc.).

6. **`'ktop.service - HQPlayer Desktop Service'`** (with quotes)
   - This name looks suspicious—it doesn’t match any normal HQPlayer file. Possibly it’s a **typo** or **leftover** from editing the systemd service file. It’s **not** part of the normal HQPlayer config.
   - If you check its contents (`cat 'ktop.service - HQPlayer Desktop Service'`), you may see leftover text from the systemd unit. If you don’t need it, you can safely remove it (`rm 'ktop.service - HQPlayer Desktop Service'`).

---

## If You Want a Clean Slate

Since you mentioned wanting to remove custom configs and start from scratch:

1. **Stop/Disable** the HQPlayer service if it’s still enabled:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop hqplayer5desktop.service
   sudo systemctl disable hqplayer5desktop.service
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
2. **Back up or remove** your `~/.hqplayer` directory:
   - If you **don’t** need your license or old configs:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/.hqplayer
     ```
     (This is permanent!)
   - Otherwise, **rename** it:
     ```bash
     mv ~/.hqplayer ~/.hqplayer.bak
     ```
     Then create a blank new one if you like:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/.hqplayer
     ```
3. **Remove** the suspicious leftover file:
   ```bash
   rm 'ktop.service - HQPlayer Desktop Service'
   ```
4. (Optional) **Reinstall** HQPlayer or just run it without the old configs. HQPlayer will recreate any missing folders/files on first launch. If you need your HQPlayer license, copy back just `hqplayer5desktop-key.xml` from the backup.

---

### Verifying HQPlayer is Gone / Reset

- After removing or renaming `~/.hqplayer/`, there should be **no** prior config or library data.
- No systemd service means HQPlayer **won’t** run on boot.
- When you run HQPlayer (Desktop or Embedded) again, it’ll generate fresh config files.

That’s all it takes to start fresh with HQPlayer, removing any old service files or custom configurations you had in place.


#### You:

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-15T19:58:10.042Z" title="1/16/2025, 4:58:10 AM">04:58</time>

Below is a **step-by-step guide** to completely remove your old HQPlayer setup so you can start with a **clean slate**. This will leave you free to reinstall HQPlayer, create a new config, or just run it manually when you’re ready.

---

## 1. Stop and Disable the Existing HQPlayer Service

1. **Stop** the running service immediately (if it’s running):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```

2. **Disable** the service so it does not start again on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```

3. **Reload** systemd to remove any references to that service from memory:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

---

## 2. (Optional) Remove the Systemd Unit File

If you previously placed a custom file at `/etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service`, you can remove it:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service
```

Or, if you prefer to keep it around as a backup:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service /etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service.bak
```

Then **reload** one more time (just for cleanliness):

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Now, HQPlayer will no longer launch on boot from any custom systemd configuration.

---

## 3. Clear Out the Old HQPlayer Config Files

HQPlayer typically uses a hidden directory under your home folder called `~/.hqplayer`. Inside it, you’ll see files like:

- `settings.xml` or `hqplayer.xml`
- `auth.xml`
- `hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`
- `library.xml`
- `current.m3u8`
- Possibly leftover files with odd names (like `'ktop.service - HQPlayer Desktop Service'`)

### 3.1 If You Want to Save Your License File

1. **Copy** (or move) your license file (usually `hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`) somewhere safe, such as your home folder:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.hqplayer/hqplayer5desktop-key.xml ~/
   ```
   That way, you can restore it easily later.

2. **Also** copy any other files you want to keep (e.g., `auth.xml`, if you need it).

### 3.2 Remove or Rename the Entire `.hqplayer` Directory

- To **remove** it completely (no backup):
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.hqplayer
  ```
  *Be sure you’ve already saved your license file if you need it!*

- Or, to **rename** it for backup:
  ```bash
  mv ~/.hqplayer ~/.hqplayer.bak
  ```

Either way, you now have **no old config** to interfere with a fresh start.

---

## 4. (Optional) Uninstall HQPlayer

If you also want to remove HQPlayer’s binary and packages from your system:

- For **APT-based** distros (Debian, Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove hqplayer-desktop
  ```
- For **RPM-based** distros (Fedora, Red Hat):
  ```bash
  sudo rpm -e hqplayer-desktop
  ```
- If you installed via a **tarball**, remove the binary (e.g., `/usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop`) and any associated symlinks manually.

Otherwise, if you plan to keep HQPlayer installed, just skip this.

---

## 5. Confirm HQPlayer No Longer Runs at Boot

Reboot or check the status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
```

You should see **“Unit hqplayer5desktop.service could not be found”** or something similar if you removed the file. If you simply disabled it, you’ll see **“Loaded: loaded (...), Active: inactive (dead)”** after a reboot.

---

## 6. Clean Slate Achieved!

At this point:

1. **No** systemd service remains (or it’s disabled).
2. **No** `~/.hqplayer` directory or config files remain (unless you kept them in a backup).
3. HQPlayer is **not** running automatically.

**When you’re ready**:

- Reinstall HQPlayer (if you uninstalled).
- Launch HQPlayer manually or via a new, clean systemd service file (if desired).
- Copy your license file (`hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`) back into `~/.hqplayer` if needed.

HQPlayer will create a fresh config directory next time it runs. You can then set up everything anew—like filters, modulator, device, and so on—using either the GUI or your own config approach.

---

### Summary

1. **Stop & Disable** the old HQPlayer systemd service, remove or rename it.
2. **Remove** or **rename** `~/.hqplayer` to clear old configs.
3. (Optional) **Uninstall** HQPlayer if you don’t want it on the system at all.
4. Reboot or check the service status to confirm HQPlayer doesn’t start automatically.

You’ll now have a completely **fresh environment** to reinstall or reconfigure HQPlayer from scratch. Enjoy your clean slate!

Below is a **step-by-step** guide to **reinstall HQPlayer**, configure it so that it **automatically starts on boot** via a **systemd** service, **loads the required settings** on startup, and ensures you can **play music through it** (e.g., from Roon or another player). The commands assume you’re on an Ubuntu/Debian-based distro, but the procedure is similar for other distros.

---

## 1. Reinstall HQPlayer

1. **Download** or **obtain** the HQPlayer package (e.g., `.deb` file) from the Signalyst website (or the method you used previously).

2. **Install** it. For example, if you have a `.deb` file:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./hqplayer-desktop_*.deb
   ```
   (Replace the filename as needed.)

3. **Verify** the hqplayer binary is installed:
   ```bash
   which hqplayer5desktop
   ```
   If it shows a path like `/usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop`, you’re good.

---

## 2. Restore Your License (If Needed)

If you have a **license key** file (e.g., `hqplayer5desktop-key.xml`), place it in:

```
~/.hqplayer/
```

so that HQPlayer runs fully licensed. If you previously cleared that directory, you may need to recreate it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hqplayer
cp /path/to/hqplayer5desktop-key.xml ~/.hqplayer
```

(Adjust as needed.)

---

## 3. Create or Update HQPlayer Settings

### 3.1 Option A: Use a Headless (CLI) Approach

If you want to rely solely on **command-line** (or systemd unit) parameters each time, you can skip creating a custom `settings.xml` and let HQPlayer pick up your CLI arguments.

- Pros: No manual editing of numeric IDs for filters, etc.
- Cons: Harder to tweak settings without re-editing the service file.

### 3.2 Option B: Use a **GUI** Once to Save `settings.xml`

1. Temporarily start HQPlayer in a **GUI** environment:
   ```bash
   hqplayer5desktop
   ```
2. **Configure** your device, filters (e.g., poly-sinc-ext3), modulator, etc., and ensure “Allow control from network” is checked if you plan to connect from Roon or a remote HQPlayer Client.
3. **Exit** HQPlayer normally. It writes your new config to `~/.hqplayer/settings.xml` (or `hqplayer.xml`, depending on version).
4. Next time HQPlayer starts in headless mode, it will load those saved settings automatically (as long as you don’t override them with CLI arguments in the systemd service).

Either approach is fine. You can also **combine** them (e.g., rely on an existing `settings.xml` but add a few CLI flags via systemd).

---

## 4. Create a New Systemd Service File

Let’s create a minimal service file called `/etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service` that **runs HQPlayer** headless on boot. Below is an **example** that references some typical CLI arguments. Adjust paths and parameters as needed!

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HQPlayer Desktop Service
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple

# Run HQPlayer as user 'ashwin'
User=ashwin
WorkingDirectory=/home/ashwin

# Environment variables if desired
Environment=HQPLAYER_HOME=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-ashwin"

# Actual HQPlayer command line
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
    --backend="NetworkAudioAdapter" \
    --device="Red" \
    --sdp=DoP \
    --adaptive-rate \
    --logfile=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log

# Adjust to your preferences:
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutStartSec=60
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

# Optional CPU pinning or scheduling optimizations:
# CPUAffinity=0-31
# Nice=-10
# IOSchedulingClass=realtime
# IOSchedulingPriority=0

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Things to note**:

1. **ExecStart**: If you want to pass filters, modulator, DSD rate, etc. from the command line, put them here. Or if you prefer to rely on the HQPlayer `settings.xml`, keep the CLI minimal.
2. **xvfb-run**: Because HQPlayer Desktop is a GUI application, using `xvfb-run` allows it to run headlessly. If you have HQPlayer Embedded, you might not need Xvfb at all.
3. **User=ashwin**: Adjust the username to whichever user should run HQPlayer.
4. If you want to **match** the advanced CLI you used in the past (e.g., `--filter=poly-sinc-ext3`, `--modulator=asdm7ecv3`, `--rate=DSD512`, etc.), just add them to the `ExecStart` line.

---

## 5. Enable and Start the Service

1. **Reload systemd** after creating the file:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
2. **Enable** it for auto-start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
3. **Start** it now:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```
4. **Check** status/logs:
   ```bash
   systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
   journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
   ```
   You should see “active (running)” if all is well.

---

## 6. Confirm HQPlayer is Listening for Connections

If you’re using HQPlayer to play music from Roon or a remote HQPlayer client, you typically need HQPlayer to be **listening** on port **4321**. If you allowed remote control from network, run:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep 4321
```

You should see a line like `0.0.0.0:4321` or `127.0.0.1:4321` indicating it’s listening. If not, ensure you **enabled** “Allow control from network” in HQPlayer’s settings or used the correct CLI parameter for remote control.

---

## 7. Test Playback

**If you’re using Roon**:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Setup** → **HQPlayer** in Roon.
2. Enter `127.0.0.1` (if on the same machine) or `<server-ip>` with **Port 4321**.
3. Enable the HQPlayer zone. Attempt to play something. If HQPlayer is configured properly, you’ll see HQPlayer logs / Roon logs indicating success.

**If you’re using a local HQPlayer library**:

1. If HQPlayer Desktop is purely headless, you might add content via its library scanning. Or you can run HQPlayer with a GUI once to configure the library.
2. Start playback from the HQPlayer interface or remote HQPDcontrol app, etc.

---

## 8. Confirm it Starts on Reboot

Finally, **reboot** your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Once you log back in, confirm:

```bash
systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
```

It should show **active (running)**. If so, HQPlayer is now autostarting on boot with your chosen settings, and you can **play music** through it (Roon or other sources).

---

### Summary

1. **Reinstall** HQPlayer (and copy license file if needed).
2. **Create** a fresh systemd service file in `/etc/systemd/system/hqplayer5desktop.service` with either minimal or advanced CLI arguments.
3. **Enable** and **start** the service, verify logs.
4. **Check** that HQPlayer is listening on port 4321 if you plan to connect from Roon or HQPlayer clients.
5. **Test** playback from Roon (or local library), then **reboot** to ensure it auto-starts.

At this point, HQPlayer is fully reinstalled, **auto-starts on boot**, loads the **required settings** from either the CLI or `settings.xml`, and is **capable of playing music**. Enjoy your new clean setup!

Below is an overview of **how your current HQPlayer `settings.xml` and systemd service file work together**, plus some **tips** to ensure the configuration is as you intend.

---

## 1. **What Your `settings.xml` Does**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<hqplayer>
    <engine adaptive_rate="1" auto_family="0" cd_drive="/dev/cdrom" channels="2"
            cuda="1" cuda_cdev="0" cuda_dev="0" direct_sdm="1" dsd_6db="0"
            ecores="default" fft_size="16384" gain_comp="0" idle_time="0"
            multicore="1" pdm_conv="6" pdm_filt="0" pipelines="0"
            playlist_album_gain="0" pre_before_meter="0" quick_pause="0"
            sdm_conversion="2" sdm_integrator="5" short_buffer="0"
            type="network" volume_limit="-10" volume_min="-60">

        <defaults bitrate="24576000" dither="5" filter="22" filter1x="37"
                  mode="1" modulator="16" oversampling="32" oversampling1x="43"
                  samplerate="512000"/>
        
        <alsa any_dsd="0" channel_offset="0" dac_bits="0" device=""
              dualwire="0" pack_sdm="0" period_time="0"/>
        
        <network address="Red" any_dsd="1" dac_bits="0" device="hw:CARD=RED,DEV=0"
                 dualwire="0" ipv6="0" pack_sdm="1" period_time="0"/>
        
        <null/>
        <convolution/>
    </engine>
    <log enabled="1"/>
</hqplayer>
```

1. **type="network"**\
   Tells HQPlayer to use the “NetworkAudioAdapter” style output. This is typically used for a locally attached device via NAA or a remote endpoint. Since you have `address="Red"` and `device="hw:CARD=RED,DEV=0"`, it suggests an NAA named “Red” that internally points to the hardware card `hw:CARD=RED,DEV=0`.

2. **DSD-related settings**
   - `bitrate="24576000"` and `samplerate="512000"` typically indicate 48 kHz-based DSD512 (512 × 48 kHz = 24.576 MHz). That’s correct if your DAC supports 48k multiples for DSD.
   - `direct_sdm="1"` means you’re bypassing PCM routines when input is DSD.
   - `pdm_conv="6"` and `pdm_filt="0"` are numeric codes indicating a certain DSD conversion (“xfi,” “poly-lin,” etc.) depending on HQPlayer’s internal enumerations.

3. **Filters, Modulator, Dither** (the numeric IDs)
   - `filter="22"`, `filter1x="37"`, `modulator="16"`, `oversampling="32"`, `oversampling1x="43"`, etc. are **HQPlayer’s internal** enumerations. If you previously determined that “22” = poly-sinc-ext3 or “32” = poly-sinc-gauss-long, etc., that’s fine. Just remember that the numbers aren’t guaranteed to match across HQPlayer versions.

4. **CUDA Offload**
   - `cuda="1"`, `cuda_dev="0"`, and `cuda_cdev="0"` implies HQPlayer is set to use your NVIDIA GPU #0 for offloading DSP tasks. If you have an NVIDIA GPU and the driver is installed, that should work as intended.

5. **Volume / Gains**
   - `volume_limit="-10"` means HQPlayer’s internal volume can’t go above **-10 dBFS**—a built-in safety margin.
   - `volume_min="-60"` indicates the lowest software volume is -60 dBFS.

6. **Logging**
   - `<log enabled="1"/>` means HQPlayer will produce logs, typically either in `~/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log` or as you set with a CLI `--logfile`. If you haven’t specified `--logfile=...` on the command line, it logs to the default location.

If you **run HQPlayer with no conflicting CLI arguments**, these settings will load automatically.

---

## 2. **What Your Systemd Service Does**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=HQPlayer Desktop Service
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ashwin
WorkingDirectory=/home/ashwin
Environment=HQPLAYER_HOME=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-ashwin"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutStartSec=60
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

1. **ExecStart** = `/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop`
   - This **does not** pass any command-line arguments like `--filter`, `--modulator`, etc. Hence, HQPlayer will rely **exclusively** on your `settings.xml` for all DSP/DSD device settings.
   - `xvfb-run` provides a “headless X server” so HQPlayer Desktop (a GUI program) can run without needing a real display.

2. **User=ashwin**
   - Means HQPlayer runs under the `ashwin` account. The `HQPLAYER_HOME=/home/ashwin/.hqplayer` environment variable ensures it looks in `~ashwin/.hqplayer/` for settings.

3. **No CPU pinning**
   - You’ve commented out CPUAffinity, Nice, IOScheduling. If you want to re-enable them, just remove the comment (#) lines. If you’re fine letting Linux schedule HQPlayer automatically, leave it as is.

4. **Starts on Boot**
   - If you enabled this unit (`sudo systemctl enable hqplayer5desktop.service`), it will run automatically at boot, launching HQPlayer with your `settings.xml` config.

---

## 3. **Does This Setup Look Right?**

**Yes**, if your goal is:

- HQPlayer runs at **system boot** as a background service (desktop application running under Xvfb).
- HQPlayer automatically loads the **parameters** from `settings.xml` (since no CLI arguments override them).
- You’re using a **network**-type HQPlayer output with a device named “Red” referencing `hw:CARD=RED,DEV=0`.
- You want to **offload** DSP to an NVIDIA GPU (`cuda_dev="0"`).

**Potential Considerations**:

1. **Check if you need to “Allow control from network”**
   - If you plan to use HQPlayer with Roon or another remote control, ensure HQPlayer is listening on port 4321. Typically, in the GUI, there’s a checkbox for “Allow control from network.” If that’s not enabled in `settings.xml` or the GUI, Roon won’t connect.
   - You can confirm by running:
     ```bash
     ss -tlnp | grep 4321
     ```
     after HQPlayer starts.

2. **FFT size mismatch**
   - If you previously used `--fft=32768` in your old CLI but now `settings.xml` has `fft_size="16384"`, note that the new config will default to 16k. If you truly want 32k, update the `fft_size="32768"` in `settings.xml`, or add `--fft=32768` to your ExecStart line.

3. **Volume limit**
   - `volume_limit="-10"` is a personal choice for extra headroom. If you find it too quiet, you could raise it (e.g., `0`) or do it from the HQPlayer GUI if you run it once with a real X server and then save settings.

4. **DSD Rate**
   - `samplerate="512000"` is a numeric code for **DSD512**. `bitrate="24576000"` is for 48k-based DSD512. Make sure your hardware actually wants 48k-based multiples. If your DAC only handles 44.1k multiples for DSD512, you might need `22579200` instead.

5. **Logs**
   - You have `<log enabled="1"/>` in `settings.xml`, so logs typically go to `~/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log` or the default location. If you prefer a different path, you can add `--logfile=/path/to/log.log` in `ExecStart`.

---

## 4. **How to Verify it Works**

1. **Enable + Start** the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hqplayer5desktop.service
   sudo systemctl start hqplayer5desktop.service
   ```

2. **Check** its status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status hqplayer5desktop.service
   journalctl -u hqplayer5desktop.service -b --no-pager
   ```
   You should see **“active (running)”** with no “failed to parse” errors.

3. **Confirm** HQPlayer is applying your filters, modulator, etc.
   - If you have a GUI environment, open HQPlayer Desktop (not the service) just to check. Or look at logs for lines referencing your chosen filter (“22”), modulator (“16”), etc.
   - If you’re using Roon or another controller, see if Roon sees HQPlayer at `127.0.0.1:4321` or `<server-ip>:4321`.

4. **Play Music**
   - If you’re using a local library in HQPlayer, you can run the

It looks like your **HQPlayer Desktop Service** is now running successfully as a **systemd** service on boot. The logs show no errors; HQPlayer started in a headless X session (`Xvfb`) and loaded your locale settings. Here are some quick checks and next steps to ensure you can **play music** through it:

---

## 1. Confirm HQPlayer Is Listening for Roon/Remote Control (If Needed)

If you plan to use HQPlayer with **Roon** (or a remote HQPlayer client), typically HQPlayer listens on **port 4321** for control. By default, HQPlayer might disable network control unless you enabled **“Allow control from network”** in its settings. To verify:

1. **Check if port 4321 is open**:
   ```bash
   ss -tlnp | grep 4321
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep 4321
   ```
   - If you see something like `0.0.0.0:4321` or `127.0.0.1:4321`, HQPlayer is listening.
   - If you get **no** result, HQPlayer is not currently listening on that port—possibly network control is disabled.

2. **Enable network control** (if not already):
   - If you can run HQPlayer Desktop once with a GUI (instead of the systemd service), open **File → Settings** and look for a checkbox like **“Allow control from network”**. Make sure it’s enabled, then close HQPlayer.
   - Next time you run HQPlayer (including via systemd), it should listen on port 4321.

---

## 2. Verify Audio Device and NAA Settings

You mentioned in `settings.xml` that you have `type="network"` and `address="Red"`. That implies you’re using a Network Audio Adapter (NAA) endpoint called **“Red”**. If you’re actually connecting to a local device (like `hw:CARD=RED,DEV=0`) on the same machine, you can do one of:

1. **Switch** to ALSA backend in the settings.xml if the device is truly local.
2. If you’re using a separate NAA device (like a Raspberry Pi or microRendu named “Red”), ensure that endpoint is **running** and on the same network so HQPlayer can stream to it.

---

## 3. Check the HQPlayer Log

If you left `<log enabled="1"/>` in `settings.xml` (and did **not** override `--logfile` on the command line), HQPlayer often logs to:

```
~/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
```

Open that file to see if HQPlayer logged any messages about:

- Finding the NAA named “Red”
- Loading filters or oversampling settings
- CUDA offload usage

For example:

```bash
cat ~/.hqplayer/HQPlayer5Desktop.log
```

You might see lines confirming that the filter/modulator was loaded, or any errors if HQPlayer can’t see the NAA.

---

## 4. Test Playback

### 4.1 If Using **Roon**

1. In **Roon**, go to **Settings** → **Setup** (or **Audio**, depending on the version) and look for HQPlayer.
2. Enter the IP (or `localhost`) and port (4321) if needed.
3. Try playing a track to the HQPlayer zone. Check HQPlayer’s log or Roon’s log for connection attempts.

### 4.2 If Using **Local HQPlayer Library**

1. Normally you’d open the HQPlayer GUI, add a folder to the library, then pick a track.
2. But since you’re running it headless, you can either:
   - Temporarily start HQPlayer **without** systemd and let the GUI appear if you have X forwarding.
   - Or use HQPDControl (a mobile app for HQPlayer) or another remote client to select music.

### 4.3 If Using Another **Remote Control** App

- Make sure “Allow control from network” is on, and point the app to your HQPlayer server IP and port 4321.

## 5. Optional Tweaks

1. **CPU Pinning**: If you want to pin HQPlayer to certain cores for performance, uncomment and adjust:
   ```ini
   CPUAffinity=0-31
   ```
   in your systemd service.

2. **Different Filters / Rate**: If you’d like to tweak filters (e.g., switch from `poly-sinc-gauss-long` to `poly-sinc-ext3`), you can either:
   - Adjust them in `settings.xml` (the numeric IDs for filters/modulators).
   - Or run a GUI session once, set them, exit, and HQPlayer will save them to the XML.

3. **Increase FFT size** if you want (e.g., `fft_size="32768"`) or match the CLI argument `--fft=32768`. Just be sure your hardware can handle it.

---

### Summary

Your logs show **HQPlayer is indeed running** under systemd as a headless service with no errors. Now:

1. **Confirm** HQPlayer is listening for remote control (if needed) on **port 4321**.
2. **Double-check** the device (NAA or local) is correctly set in `settings.xml`.
3. **Attempt playback** via Roon, HQPDControl, or local library to ensure audio passes through.

You’re almost there—once you confirm a successful playback test, your HQPlayer headless install is fully operational!

This log snippet shows **Roon** and **HQPlayer** communicating over HQPlayer’s control port (default **4321**). In particular, Roon is receiving an **“unsolicited status”** message from HQPlayer describing the **current playback state**. That’s normal: HQPlayer periodically sends XML status updates to Roon to report details like which filter it’s using, what sampling rate it’s outputting, playback position, etc. Here’s a breakdown of the key fields:

```xml
<Status
  active_filter="poly-sinc-ext3"
  active_mode="SDM (DSD)"
  active_rate="6144000"
  active_shaper="ASDM7ECv3"
  ...
/>
```

1. **active\_filter="poly-sinc-ext3"**\
   HQPlayer is using the *poly-sinc-ext3* filter. If you’ve configured “poly-sinc-ext3” in HQPlayer (either via settings.xml or the GUI), this matches what you’d expect.

2. **active\_mode="SDM (DSD)"**\
   The output signal is in DSD form (a \*Delta-Sigma Modulated\* stream), as opposed to PCM. This confirms HQPlayer is upsampling to DSD.

3. **active\_rate="6144000"**\
   This is the output sampling rate in Hz. **6,144,000 Hz** corresponds to *DSD128* at a 48 kHz base (48 kHz × 128 = 6.144 MHz).
   - If you started with a 96 kHz PCM track (as indicated by “samplerate=96000” in the metadata), then HQPlayer is converting 96 kHz PCM to 6.144 MHz DSD.
   - If you had set “adaptive rate,” HQPlayer might pick the best DSD multiple of the source sample rate, leading to DSD128 here.

4. **active\_shaper="ASDM7ECv3"**\
   The modulator (noise shaper) is **ASDM7ECv3**, a popular modulator in HQPlayer for producing DSD output.

5. **position="44.0399…"**\
   HQPlayer’s internal playback timer reports it’s at \~44 seconds into the track.

6. **remain\_sec="-44"**\
   HQPlayer sometimes displays negative remaining time for an incoming stream if it doesn’t have the total track length (e.g., live stream, or certain Roon streaming scenarios). It’s normal when HQPlayer doesn’t know the total track duration.

7. **metadata samplerate="96000"** / **bitrate="4608000"**
   - Confirms the **input** is 96 kHz PCM.
   - The “bitrate” field references the raw input bit rate (4608 kbps for 96 kHz / 24-bit / 2-channel PCM).

### Why “Unsolicited”?

In Roon’s logs, **“GOT UNSOLICITED …”** means HQPlayer sent a status update that Roon didn’t specifically request at that moment. HQPlayer does this periodically (or when playback state changes) to keep Roon aware of the current DSP/filter state, time position, etc.

### Bottom Line

This line in the Roon logs indicates:

- **HQPlayer** and **Roon** are successfully connected.
- HQPlayer is **upsampling** a 96 kHz PCM input to **DSD128** (6.144 MHz) using the **poly-sinc-ext3** filter and **ASDM7ECv3** modulator.
- Playback is at about **44 seconds** into the track, and HQPlayer is reporting its status in real time.

Seeing these messages in Roon’s logs confirms **everything is functioning** as expected between Roon and HQPlayer.

how can i force dsd512

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-15T21:00:23.216Z" title="1/16/2025, 6:00:23 AM">06:00</time>

To **force HQPlayer** to always upsample to **DSD512**, you can configure it in one of the following ways (depending on whether you’re using HQPlayer Desktop, Embedded, or a CLI/systemd setup). In general, you need to **explicitly set the output sample rate** to DSD512 instead of letting HQPlayer choose adaptively.

---

## 1. **If You Have the HQPlayer **GUI** (Desktop)**

1. **Open HQPlayer** (with a real X/desktop environment or remote X-forwarding).

2. **Go to Settings** → **Main window**. You’ll see drop-downs for:
   - **Filter** (e.g., poly-sinc-ext3)
   - **Modulator** (e.g., ASDM7ECv3)
   - **Sample rate** selection.

3. In the **Sample rate** drop-down, **select DSD512** (sometimes labeled as “DSD512(44.1k)” or “DSD512(48k)” depending on your DAC’s native multiple).

4. **Ensure** that “Auto” or “Adaptive” is **not** selected; otherwise HQPlayer will choose the best rate automatically.

5. **Apply/OK** to save changes and then restart playback.

HQPlayer will now **always** attempt to output DSD512, regardless of the input rate. If your hardware doesn’t support the chosen DSD512 multiple (e.g., 44.1k vs 48k base), HQPlayer might fail or revert to a lower rate automatically.

---

## 2. **If You Use HQPlayer’s **CLI** (systemd / headless / Embedded)**

You can **force** DSD512 in your ExecStart line (systemd) or your CLI invocation:

1. **Add** `--rate=DSD512` to your HQPlayer command. For example:
   ```bash
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop \
       --filter=poly-sinc-ext3 \
       --modulator=asdm7ecv3 \
       --rate=DSD512 \
       ...
   ```
   This ensures HQPlayer tries to output DSD512 at a **44.1k multiple** (44.1kHz × 512 = 22.5792 MHz). If your DAC or system expects a **48k multiple** for DSD512 (24.576 MHz), HQPlayer will detect that from the DAC’s capabilities. In some versions you may see separate flags like `--sdm-rate=22579200` or `--sdm-rate=24576000` for specifying the exact frequency.

2. **If you prefer editing `settings.xml`** directly:
   - Look for `<defaults samplerate="xxxxxxx" ... />`.
   - For **DSD512 at 44.1k** multiples, you’d put something like `samplerate="22579200"`.
   - For **DSD512 at 48k** multiples, use `samplerate="24576000"`.
   - For example:
     ```xml
     <defaults
       ...
       samplerate="22579200"  <!-- for 44.1k-based DSD512 -->
       ...
     />
     ```
   - Then remove any “adaptive rate” flags or set `adaptive_rate="0"`, so HQPlayer doesn’t override it.

---

## 3. **Roon + HQPlayer Setup**

When using Roon as the front-end:

1. **Open Roon** → **Settings** → **Audio** → Find your HQPlayer zone.
2. **Verify** that the “Sample Rate” or any HQPlayer / Roon DSP settings aren’t overriding your manual rate choice.
3. Make sure you see in the HQPlayer logs (or Roon logs) that HQPlayer is indeed attempting **DSD512**. Sometimes, if HQPlayer or your DAC can’t do DSD512 for a particular input (e.g., 96k or 192k content with certain filters), HQPlayer might downshift to a lower DSD rate.

---

## 4. **Things to Watch Out For**

- **DAC Base Multiple**: Some DACs support DSD512 only at **44.1k multiples** (22.5792 MHz), others might use **48k multiples** (24.576 MHz). If your DAC is 44.1k-based, but you force 48k-based DSD512, HQPlayer may fail or fallback.
- **Filter Complexity**: Some filters and modulators are very CPU/GPU intensive at DSD512—make sure your system can handle it. If your hardware can’t keep up, you’ll get dropouts or stuttering.
- **Adaptive vs Fixed Rate**: If you previously used “Adaptive Rate” or “Auto,” HQPlayer tries to pick the best rate based on the input. Forcing `--rate=DSD512` always uses DSD512, so 44.1k or 48k sources will be upsampled to that rate.

---

### In Summary

To **force** HQPlayer to **always** output **DSD512**, either:

1. **In the GUI**: Set **Sample rate** to **DSD512** (rather than “Auto”).
2. **Via CLI**: Add `--rate=DSD512` (or set `samplerate="22579200"` in `settings.xml` for 44.1k-based DSD512).
3. **Disable** any “Adaptive” or “Auto” rate selection to avoid HQPlayer picking a lower rate.

Once done, HQPlayer will upsample all inputs to **DSD512**, as long as your CPU/GPU and DAC can handle it.

i'd like to have the best quality all the time without any compatability issues. is adaptive rate still the right choice

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-15T21:02:26.211Z" title="1/16/2025, 6:02:26 AM">06:02</time>

In HQPlayer, **Adaptive Rate** (sometimes called “Auto” or “Auto rate family”) tells HQPlayer to choose the highest available output rate that is a *multiple* of the source rate. For example, if you play a 44.1 kHz track, HQPlayer might upsample to a 44.1 kHz–based DSD rate (like DSD256 or DSD512, whichever it can achieve). If you switch to a 48 kHz track, it might upsample to a 48 kHz–based rate (e.g., 24.576 MHz for DSD512 at 48 k multiples).

Whether **Adaptive Rate** is “best” depends on:

1. **Your DAC’s Base Rates**
   - Some DACs do DSD512 only on 44.1 kHz multiples, others handle both 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz bases, and a few can’t do DSD512 at all.
   - If your DAC and filters support both 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz–based DSD at high rates, Adaptive Rate will seamlessly switch between them when playing 44.1 or 48 kHz–sourced content. This avoids any “pulling” or off-multiple conversions that can degrade quality or cause compatibility issues.

2. **Your CPU/GPU Load**
   - Some filters or modulators are extremely heavy at certain rates—especially DSD512. If your hardware handles 44.1 kHz multiples better than 48 kHz multiples (or vice versa), Adaptive Rate can help HQPlayer pick the rate your system can handle for each source.
   - Conversely, if you force a single maximum rate (like “DSD512” at 48 kHz base) but your CPU can’t sustain that with a 44.1 kHz input, you might get dropouts.

3. **Desire for a Single Highest Rate vs. “Correct” Base Rate**
   - **For maximum theoretical quality** on every track, many users pick the highest stable DSD rate their hardware can reliably do—like forcing DSD512. All incoming sources (44.1 or 48 family) are then *re-sampled* to that single rate.
   - However, if you have a mix of 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz–based sources, forcing them all to a single base can lead HQPlayer to perform a “cross family” conversion (e.g., 48 kHz content forced to a 44.1-based multiple). While that usually still sounds good, some prefer to keep each family in its own base rate for minimal fractional conversion steps.

4. **Compatibility vs. Simplicity**
   - **Adaptive Rate** = fewer manual changes when switching between 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz source material, and it typically yields a direct integer multiple for each source family. That can avoid any issues if your DAC strongly prefers integer multiples of the source.
   - **Fixed Rate** = consistent output (say, DSD512 for every track), which is simpler for some DACs and can be considered “best quality” if your system has the horsepower for that rate on *all* input families. But if your DAC or CPU can’t handle 48 kHz–based DSD512 well, forcing that rate could cause stuttering or fallback.

---

### Which Approach Is “Best Quality” with Fewer Issues?

- **If your DAC + CPU/GPU** reliably handle **DSD512** at **both** 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz multiples, you can safely use **Adaptive Rate**. HQPlayer will always pick the highest *matching* multiple (e.g., DSD512 for both 44.1 kHz content and 48 kHz content). That helps avoid cross-multiples and typically yields clean results.
- **If your DAC** supports **DSD512** at only one family (often 44.1 kHz) and not at 48 kHz, or your CPU can’t sustain 48 kHz–based upsampling at the same level, you might see HQPlayer shift to a lower rate for 48 kHz sources (e.g., DSD256). That is still “best possible” for each family and avoids glitches.
- **If you insist** on a single maximum upsampling rate (like forcing 22.5792 MHz or 24.576 MHz DSD512 for *every* source) and your system is powerful enough, that can yield a consistent experience and (arguably) top-tier quality—**but** you sacrifice the advantage of integer relationships on mismatched source families (if they differ from your chosen base).

Most HQPlayer users seeking **highest fidelity** with minimal fuss will keep **Adaptive Rate** turned **on**, so each source family (44.1 or 48) maps cleanly to the maximum stable DSD rate the DAC + CPU can handle. That prevents performance or compatibility surprises for 48 kHz–based material. If you’re certain your hardware manages *all input families* at your chosen DSD512 rate without dropouts, forcing a single highest rate can be just as good—just verify your gear’s performance and watch for any fractional conversions.

---

**In short**: If you want to avoid potential *cross family* conversions or CPU overload scenarios and ensure stable, optimum upsampling for *both* 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz content, **Adaptive Rate** is still a great choice. If your setup is guaranteed to run at a single DSD512 rate no matter what the source is, and you don’t mind forcing all material to that rate, you can disable Adaptive Rate and pick that single highest rate. Both approaches can achieve excellent results, so it really comes down to whether your DAC/hardware can seamlessly handle all input families at your forced rate.

These **Roon logs** show HQPlayer sending **status updates** back to Roon (“GOT UNSOLICITED …”), indicating **real-time playback** details. A few key points:

1. **Source Material**:
   - You can see `mime="application/x-hqplayer-raw"` with `samplerate="96000"` and `bits="24"`, which indicates **24-bit / 96 kHz** PCM input (in this case from TIDAL FLAC).

2. **HQPlayer Output**:
   - `active_mode="SDM (DSD)"` and `active_rate="6144000"` show HQPlayer is outputting **DSD** at **6.144 MHz** (DSD128 at a 48 kHz base).
   - `active_filter="poly-sinc-ext3"` and `active_shaper="ASDM7ECv3"` reveal the filter and modulator in use.

3. **Position and Time**:
   - Lines like `display_position="699.08"` or `"707.08"` reflect the playback position in seconds. Roon polls these status messages to update its UI timeline.
   - `begin_min="11" begin_sec="47" remain_min="-11" remain_sec="-47"` show HQPlayer’s internal timing can sometimes display negative remainders if HQPlayer doesn’t have a fixed total track length. (HQPlayer can be a bit quirky in how it reports “remaining time” if it’s receiving a constant stream.)

4. **Everything Is Working**
   - Getting these repeated **“UNSOLICITED”** XML `<Status>` blocks means HQPlayer is actively streaming and Roon sees the continuous status updates.
   - The conversion from 24/96 PCM → DSD128 (6.144 MHz) via **poly-sinc-ext3** + **ASDM7ECv3** is proceeding normally.

---

## Why HQPlayer Chose DSD128 @ 6.144 MHz

- **Adaptive or Auto Rate**: If your DAC and settings are set to adapt to input families (44.1 kHz vs 48 kHz), HQPlayer might have decided that **DSD128** at 48 kHz multiples (6.144 MHz) was the best match for this 96 kHz source.
- **CPU/Filters**: If your hardware or filter selection can’t sustain a higher DSD rate (like DSD256 or DSD512) at 96 kHz input, HQPlayer may automatically pick DSD128 to avoid dropouts.

If you **want** to force a higher DSD rate (e.g., DSD256 or DSD512) all the time, you could:

1. **Disable Adaptive Rate** and pick `--rate=DSD256` or `--rate=DSD512` (CLI), or select **DSD256/DSD512** in the HQPlayer Desktop GUI.
2. Make sure your DAC truly supports that rate at a 48 kHz base (24.576 MHz for DSD512 or 12.288 MHz for DSD256) and that your CPU can handle the chosen filter/modulator at those speeds.

---

### Summary

These log lines confirm:

- **Roon** and **HQPlayer** are communicating successfully over port **4321**.
- HQPlayer is **upsampling** a **96 kHz** TIDAL FLAC to **DSD128** at **6.144 MHz** using **poly-sinc-ext3 + ASDM7ECv3**.
- The repeated “unsolicited” `<Status>` messages are normal—HQPlayer regularly pushes playback status updates to Roon in real-time.

Seeing this in the Roon logs means your HQPlayer–Roon integration is **healthy** and functioning as designed. If you’re happy with DSD128, you’re good to go. If you want a higher or different DSD rate, adjust HQPlayer’s settings (either in the GUI or via `--rate=` / `samplerate=` in the config).

<time datetime="2025-01-15T21:15:10.204Z" title="1/16/2025, 6:15:10 AM">06:15</time>

From these logs, you can see that **HQPlayer** ended up using **“poly-sinc-gauss-hires-lp”** at **DSD128 (6.144 MHz)** output—despite what you put in `settings.xml` (like `filter="22"` or a different `samplerate`). A few key observations and reasons why this might happen:

---

## 1. HQPlayer is Showing a Different Filter Than `settings.xml`

In `settings.xml` you wrote:

```xml
<defaults bitrate="24576000" filter="22" samplerate="512000" ... />
```

But HQPlayer logs say:

```
active_filter="poly-sinc-gauss-hires-lp"
```

which **numerically** corresponds to **value="43"** (based on the “GetFilters” list). That means HQPlayer is **not** actually using the filter ID of `22` from your file. Instead, it’s using the enumerated filter ID `43`.

### **Why the Mismatch?**

1. **Version Differences**: The numeric IDs for filters can shift between HQPlayer versions. If your `settings.xml` was created on an older version or manually edited, “filter=22” might now map to something else in the new version—or might be ignored if it’s out of range.
2. **GUI Override**: If you opened HQPlayer Desktop in a GUI and changed the filter to “poly-sinc-gauss-hires-lp,” it will store that filter’s numeric ID in some part of the config—overriding your older numeric value.
3. **Auto-Selection**: In rare cases, if HQPlayer sees an invalid numeric code, it may fallback to a default or last-known valid filter.

**Bottom line**: The filter enumerations in HQPlayer are often version-specific. If you want a specific filter, confirm its numeric ID by selecting it in the HQPlayer GUI once, then re-check the newly saved `settings.xml` or `hqplayer.xml`.

## 2. HQPlayer is Outputting **DSD128** at **6.144 MHz**

Your logs show:

```
active_rate="6144000"
```

Which is **48 kHz × 128 = 6.144 MHz** = DSD128.\
Meanwhile, you have:

```xml
samplerate="512000"
bitrate="24576000"
```

in `settings.xml`.

- **`bitrate="24576000"`** suggests 48k-based **DSD512** (24.576 MHz).
- **`samplerate="512000"`** might try to indicate DSD512 in PCM-coded form (some older HQPlayer versions used “512000” to represent 512 × 1000?).

Yet the logs confirm HQPlayer actually chose **DSD128**. Common reasons:

1. **Adaptive Rate is Off, but Another Setting Overrode**: Even though `adaptive_rate="0"` is set, there might be another setting or internal fallback if your system (or DAC) can’t handle DSD512 for that specific input.
2. **CPU/GPU Limitations**: If the filter+modulator load is too heavy for DSD512 at 48 kHz, HQPlayer can automatically downshift to DSD128 (6.144 MHz) to avoid stuttering.
3. **Cross-Family Input**: You’re playing a **44.1 kHz** MQA TIDAL track. If HQPlayer is locked to a 48 kHz–based DSD multiple, that’s a fractional conversion from 44.1 kHz → 48k-based DSD. HQPlayer might pick a stable lower multiple (DSD128) to handle that cross-family scenario gracefully.

If you truly want to **force DSD512**:

- **In the GUI**: Turn off Adaptive, select “DSD512” explicitly in HQPlayer’s Sample Rate dropdown.
- **In `settings.xml`**: Use `samplerate="22579200"` (for 44.1k-based DSD512) or `24576000` (for 48k-based DSD512), then confirm `adaptive_rate="0"`.
- **Check CPU Overhead**: Certain filters/modulators at DSD512 are extremely resource-intensive.

## 3. Roon is Feeding MQA @ 44.1 kHz

You see lines like:

```
mime="application/x-hqplayer-raw" samplerate="44100" sdm="0"
```

Meaning the **source** is 44.1 kHz (MQA TIDAL track). HQPlayer is converting it to 6.144 MHz DSD. If your DAC/hardware is only fully comfortable with 48k-based DSD512 or your CPU can’t handle the cross-family upsampling at DSD512, HQPlayer will settle at a lower rate (DSD128) to maintain smooth playback. This is normal and indicates HQPlayer is **protecting** you from overload or stutters.

## 4. Verifying the Correct Filter/Rate

### **Filter**

1. **Open HQPlayer Desktop** once with a GUI.
2. Manually select “poly-sinc-ext3” or whatever filter you want.
3. Close HQPlayer so it writes a fresh config.
4. Open the new config (e.g., `~/.hqplayer/settings.xml`) and see what numeric ID it used for that filter.

### **Rate**

- If you want a single forced DSD512 rate, set `adaptive_rate="0"` and `samplerate` to `22579200` (for 44.1k multiples) or `24576000` (for 48k multiples) in the `<defaults>` node.
- Make sure your CPU/GPU is powerful enough. If HQPlayer still drops to DSD128 in practice, it likely can’t sustain DSD512 with your chosen filter + modulator + source sample rate.

## 5. Summary of What’s Happening

1. **Despite** the `settings.xml` lines, HQPlayer is using “poly-sinc-gauss-hires-lp” (ID 43) at **DSD128** (6.144 MHz).
2. This can happen if your numeric filter ID in `settings.xml` is out-of-sync with your HQPlayer version or if HQPlayer fallback logic picks a stable filter.
3. The sample rate mismatch between your config (512k / 24.576 MHz) and the actual log output (6.144 MHz) suggests HQPlayer decided not to do DSD512—possibly due to CPU load or cross-family input.

To fix it:

- **Confirm** the correct filter ID by setting it in the HQPlayer GUI once.
- **Force** DSD512 if that’s truly desired, but watch for performance/stability.
- If you want to handle both 44.1k and 48k families at the maximum stable rate, consider **Adaptive Rate** or accept that 44.1k input may get an integer multiple at 44.1k-based DSD (like 22.5792 MHz for DSD512) or a fallback to DSD128 if 512 is too heavy.

In short, the logs show HQPlayer is choosing “**poly-sinc-gauss-hires-lp** + **DSD128**” for reliability or because of enumerations that don’t match your old XML. If that’s **not** what you want, use the HQPlayer GUI to confirm the filter and rate. That way, your `settings.xml` updates correctly, and HQPlayer will do the upsampling you intend.
