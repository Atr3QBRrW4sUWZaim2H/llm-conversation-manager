# AI-Driven Data Collection: Risks, Data Monetization, and Privacy Policy Shortcomings (US & EU)

## AI-Driven Data Collection and Privacy Risks  
Modern artificial intelligence systems thrive on massive amounts of data – so much so that “data is the new oil,” and **AI is the biggest data refinery** fueling tech innovation ([AI (and other) Companies: Quietly Changing Your Terms of Service Could Be Unfair or Deceptive | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/02/ai-other-companies-quietly-changing-your-terms-service-could-be-unfair-or-deceptive#:~:text=You%20may%20have%20heard%20that,of%20interest%3A%20they%20have%20powerful)). AI-driven services (from social media algorithms to machine-learning analytics) **continuously hunger for user data** to improve models and profits ([AI (and other) Companies: Quietly Changing Your Terms of Service Could Be Unfair or Deceptive | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/02/ai-other-companies-quietly-changing-your-terms-service-could-be-unfair-or-deceptive#:~:text=it%20must%20be%20collected%20at,existing%20commitments%20to%20protect%20their)). This creates a strong incentive for corporations to **collect, share, and monetize personal data** on an unprecedented scale. Often, this pursuit pits **business interests against consumer privacy**, as companies seek to **“turn the abundant flow of user data” into fuel for AI products** ([AI (and other) Companies: Quietly Changing Your Terms of Service Could Be Unfair or Deceptive | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/02/ai-other-companies-quietly-changing-your-terms-service-could-be-unfair-or-deceptive#:~:text=continuous%20appetite%20for%20more%20and,to%20protect%20their%20users%E2%80%99%20privacy)). 

A major risk is that *AI amplifies the scope of data collection* – scraping information from every digital trace we leave. Today’s generative AI models, for example, are largely built on **data scraped across the internet**, raising alarms about what personal information is being vacuumed up and how it’s used ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=generative%20AI%20has%20drawn%20attention,one%2C%20with%20any%20degree%20of)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=connection%20between%20scraped%20data%20and,degree%20of%20privacy%20or%20anonymity)). **Pervasive data mining** can erode any expectation of privacy or anonymity in both digital and physical spaces ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=connection%20between%20scraped%20data%20and,degree%20of%20privacy%20or%20anonymity)). In effect, individuals may have **no realistic way to opt out** of having their public posts, photos, or even movements (via location data) collected and analyzed by AI. These practices feed into what scholar Shoshana Zuboff calls *“surveillance capitalism”* – an economic order built to **surveil, influence, and exploit people through data** ([Surveillance Capitalism and AI: Is Big Brother Manipulating You? | Translational Data Analytics Institute](https://tdai.osu.edu/events/surveillance-capitalism-and-ai-big-brother-manipulating-you#:~:text=tech%20companies%2C%20mainly%20because%20of,an%20associate%20professor%20in%20the)). The combination of **AI and surveillance capitalism** means personal data is continuously harvested and analyzed to predict and shape human behavior for profit. This not only endangers individual privacy but can also lead to *societal-level harms*, such as manipulation of public opinion, discrimination by algorithms, and erosion of trust in digital services ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=This%20shift%20toward%20using%20AI,their%20employment%20application%20gets%20reviewed)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=As%20these%20systems%20proliferate%2C%20they,as%20tools%20of%20social%20control)).

## Lessons from Cambridge Analytica and Snowden Revelations  
Recent history has spotlighted how **unchecked data collection can lead to massive privacy violations**. A prime example is the **Cambridge Analytica** scandal. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, **harvested personal data from up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent** via a quiz app ([
            The Cambridge Analytica affair and Internet‐mediated research - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6073073/#:~:text=that%20these%20aspects%20of%20security,Though%20the%20information%20was)). Only a few hundred thousand users willingly gave data, but Facebook’s policies at the time allowed the app to collect *their friends’* profiles as well – none of whom were informed or consented ([
            The Cambridge Analytica affair and Internet‐mediated research - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6073073/#:~:text=access%20to%20320%2C000%20user%20profiles,turned%20out%20that%20Cambridge%20Analytica)). The firm then used this trove of personal information to build psychographic profiles and micro-target voters with political ads. Facebook discovered the abuse in 2015 but merely **asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, without alerting affected users or the public** ([
            The Cambridge Analytica affair and Internet‐mediated research - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6073073/#:~:text=use%20of%20their%20friends%E2%80%99%20data,requires%20much%20closer%20ethical%20oversight)). This delayed and muted response highlights a **serious enforcement failure** – users’ data was misused on a vast scale, yet neither the platform nor regulators intervened until journalists and whistleblowers exposed the situation in 2018. The Cambridge Analytica scandal ultimately **revealed the breadth and depth of “surveillance capitalism,”** demonstrating how personal data could be exploited to influence and manipulate people ([Surveillance Capitalism and AI: Is Big Brother Manipulating You? | Translational Data Analytics Institute](https://tdai.osu.edu/events/surveillance-capitalism-and-ai-big-brother-manipulating-you#:~:text=tech%20companies%2C%20mainly%20because%20of,an%20associate%20professor%20in%20the)). It served as a wake-up call that **data-driven algorithms can weaponize privacy weaknesses** for political and economic gain.

Equally illustrative are the **Snowden revelations** of 2013. Edward Snowden’s leaks showed that U.S. intelligence agencies (like the NSA) were conducting **mass surveillance** by tapping directly into tech companies’ data streams. Through programs like PRISM and Upstream, agencies gained access to emails, chats, and cloud data – even of Europeans – with the cooperation of major firms including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others ([Data Transfers | noyb.eu](https://noyb.eu/en/project/eu-us-transfers#:~:text=In%202013%2C%20Edward%20Snowden%20publicly,secret%20services%20without%20adequate%20protection)). In other words, vast amounts of personal data that people shared with private companies were being collected by governments **without individuals’ knowledge**. These disclosures led to global outrage and legal challenges. In the EU, they prompted Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems to sue over Facebook’s transfers of EU user data to the U.S., given the risk it could be accessed by U.S. spy agencies ([Data Transfers | noyb.eu](https://noyb.eu/en/project/eu-us-transfers#:~:text=including%20Apple%2C%20Microsoft%2C%20Facebook%2C%20Google,secret%20services%20without%20adequate%20protection)). The result was the invalidation of the EU–US “Safe Harbor” agreement in 2015, and later the “Privacy Shield” in 2019, by the EU’s highest court ([Data Transfers | noyb.eu](https://noyb.eu/en/project/eu-us-transfers#:~:text=After%20lengthy%20back%20and%20forth,another%20type%20of%20transfer%20mechanism)). The court found that U.S. surveillance laws offer insufficient privacy protection for Europeans, creating a fundamental conflict with EU privacy rights ([Data Transfers | noyb.eu](https://noyb.eu/en/project/eu-us-transfers#:~:text=%E2%80%9CStandard%20Contractual%20Clauses%E2%80%9D%2C%20which%20was,another%20type%20of%20transfer%20mechanism)). **Transatlantic data flows were thrown into legal jeopardy** as policy-makers scrambled to reconcile U.S. national security practices with EU data protection standards. Snowden’s revelations underscored that *robust privacy safeguards and oversight were lacking*, allowing government and corporate actors to collect data at a scale never disclosed to the public. 

**These past incidents highlight contemporary risks**: The Cambridge Analytica saga shows how a private company’s AI-driven profiling of social media data can undermine democracy when regulations and oversight are weak. The Snowden case shows how, without strong legal limits, personal data held by corporations can be siphoned by governments en masse, violating privacy on a global scale. Together, they illustrate why current AI-era data practices demand stronger policy responses to prevent similar or even more far-reaching abuses today.

## United States: Policy Gaps and Enforcement Challenges  
In the U.S., **privacy regulation has struggled to keep pace** with AI-driven data monetization. As of 2024, the United States still lacks a **comprehensive federal consumer privacy law** akin to the EU’s GDPR ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=As%20of%202024%2C%20the%20United,ADPPA%20would%20have%20imposed%20limits)). The closest attempt, the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA), stalled in Congress in 2022 ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=As%20of%202024%2C%20the%20United,ADPPA%20would%20have%20imposed%20limits)). In its place, the U.S. relies on a patchwork of **sector-specific laws** (for health data, children’s data, financial records, etc.) and a few **state laws**. Only 12 states have passed broad consumer privacy statutes, with California’s Consumer Privacy Act (and its update, CPRA) being the most significant ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=In%20the%20absence%20of%20consumer,As%20of%202023%2C%2012%20states)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=have%20passed%20consumer%20privacy%20regulations%2C,31)). This fragmented landscape creates many **grey areas and loopholes**. Companies often can legally collect and use personal data as long as they disclose it somewhere in a privacy policy. **No general law prevents the extensive tracking or inferencing on user data** – unless the practices violate specific consumer protection rules or a promise made by the company. 

**Enforcement in the U.S. is largely reactive.** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the de facto privacy regulator, using its authority to police “unfair or deceptive” practices. However, the FTC usually acts *after* a violation has occurred (often after a scandal breaks). A notable example is how U.S. authorities responded to Cambridge Analytica: in 2019 the FTC imposed a **record-breaking $5 billion fine on Facebook** for violating a 2012 privacy consent order ([FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and Sweeping New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook#:~:text=Facebook%2C%20Inc,privacy%20of%20their%20personal%20information)). This settlement – the largest privacy penalty ever at the time ([FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and Sweeping New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook#:~:text=Federal%20Trade%20Commission,government%20for%20any%20violation)) – came only after users’ data had already been misused and the harm done. The FTC acknowledged that **Facebook had “undermined consumers’ choices” despite promising them control over their data**, and imposed new oversight measures to improve Facebook’s privacy practices ([FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and Sweeping New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20repeated%20promises%20to%20its,%E2%80%9D)). While $5 billion is a hefty fine, critics noted that for Facebook’s parent company (Meta), which earns tens of billions in revenue, such post-hoc penalties may amount to a **cost of doing business** rather than a transformational deterrent. 

Another enforcement gap is that **innovative data-mining practices often go unchecked until after damage occurs**. For instance, for years U.S. wireless carriers sold customers’ real-time **location data** to third-party aggregators without customer consent. This sensitive information – “revealing where they go and who they are” – was treated as a commodity ([FCC Fines Wireless Carriers $200M for Sharing Location Data with Third Parties | Data Privacy + Cybersecurity Insider](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2024/05/fcc-fines-wireless-carriers-200m-for-sharing-location-data-with-third-parties/#:~:text=The%20FCC%E2%80%99s%20allegations%20include%20that,%E2%80%9D)). Only in 2020, after media reports and public pressure, did the FCC step in, ultimately fining the major carriers nearly $200 million for these privacy violations ([FCC Fines Wireless Carriers $200M for Sharing Location Data with Third Parties | Data Privacy + Cybersecurity Insider](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2024/05/fcc-fines-wireless-carriers-200m-for-sharing-location-data-with-third-parties/#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Communications%20Commission%20,%E2%80%9D)). The episode exposed how lucrative and widespread data monetization had become in the absence of clear privacy rules, and how **regulators were often a step behind** industry practices. 

**State-level efforts are plugging some holes.** Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) is a notable law that protects biometric data (like facial scans) and has enabled consumers to sue companies for misuse of such data. Under BIPA, Facebook was sued for using face-recognition on user photos without proper consent, leading to a $650 million settlement in 2020 (one of the largest privacy class-action payouts in U.S. history) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=leveraging%20the%20state%20of%20Illinois%E2%80%99,the%20impacts%20of%20these%20systems)). The same Illinois law was used in 2020 by the ACLU to sue Clearview AI – a company that built a face-recognition AI by scraping billions of online images. Clearview ultimately settled in 2022 and **agreed to stop providing its facial recognition database to most private clients nationwide and to any law enforcement in Illinois** ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=leveraging%20the%20state%20of%20Illinois%E2%80%99,the%20impacts%20of%20these%20systems)). This effectively curbed some of Clearview’s activities in the U.S., but notably, no federal law was in place to outright ban Clearview’s **AI-driven mass data collection** – it took a state law and civil litigation to impose limits. Such cases underscore that **legal protections have lagged behind technology**: companies can engage in **AI-enabled data exploitation (like facial tracking or behavioral profiling) with minimal upfront oversight**, unless they happen to violate a patchwork of existing rules.

**Key U.S. Cases and Enforcement Actions:**  
- **Facebook & Cambridge Analytica (2018):** Allowed a third-party app to harvest tens of millions of users’ data without consent for political profiling. Outcome: Facebook fined $5 billion by FTC in 2019 for privacy violations ([FTC Imposes $5 Billion Penalty and Sweeping New Privacy Restrictions on Facebook | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions-facebook#:~:text=Facebook%2C%20Inc,privacy%20of%20their%20personal%20information)), after already being fined £500k in the UK (the maximum under old law) ([Facebook to be fined £500,000 in Cambridge Analytica data scandal – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-cambridge-analytica-fine-ico-information-commissioner-elizabether-denham-brexit/#:~:text=,she%20added)).  
- **Wireless Carriers Location Sharing (2012–2019):** Major telecoms (AT&T, Verizon, etc.) sold customer location data to outsiders without consent. Outcome: FCC investigation led to ~$200 million in fines in 2020 for **illegally sharing “customers’ real-time location” data** ([FCC Fines Wireless Carriers $200M for Sharing Location Data with Third Parties | Data Privacy + Cybersecurity Insider](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2024/05/fcc-fines-wireless-carriers-200m-for-sharing-location-data-with-third-parties/#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Communications%20Commission%20,%E2%80%9D)) ([FCC Fines Wireless Carriers $200M for Sharing Location Data with Third Parties | Data Privacy + Cybersecurity Insider](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2024/05/fcc-fines-wireless-carriers-200m-for-sharing-location-data-with-third-parties/#:~:text=The%20FCC%E2%80%99s%20allegations%20include%20that,%E2%80%9D)). (No broad privacy law forbade this practice until the FCC acted under telecom-specific rules.)  
- **Facebook Facial Recognition (2010–2019):** Used AI to scan user photos for tagging suggestions without explicit consent. Outcome: Class-action under Illinois BIPA settled for $650 million in 2020, forcing Facebook to delete facial templates and honor opt-outs.  
- **Clearview AI Facial Scraping (2017–2020):** Scraped billions of online images (from social media, etc.) to build an AI facial recognition tool sold to police. Outcome: Sued under BIPA; in 2022 Clearview **agreed to stop selling its service to most private firms and barred use in Illinois** ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=leveraging%20the%20state%20of%20Illinois%E2%80%99,the%20impacts%20of%20these%20systems)) (no federal ban exists; the company still contracts with some law enforcement outside IL).  

Despite these enforcement actions, U.S. privacy oversight remains largely **reactive and fragmented**. **Policy shortcomings** – notably the absence of a universal privacy law – mean many AI-driven data collection activities still fall through the cracks. The FTC can punish unfair or deceptive conduct (as in the Facebook case or recent warnings against secretly changing privacy terms for AI uses ([AI (and other) Companies: Quietly Changing Your Terms of Service Could Be Unfair or Deceptive | Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/02/ai-other-companies-quietly-changing-your-terms-service-could-be-unfair-or-deceptive#:~:text=Companies%20might%20be%20tempted%20to,running%20afoul%20of%20the%20law))), but it **lacks power to pre-emptively set comprehensive privacy rules**. This regulatory gap leaves consumers vulnerable: companies can push the boundaries of data monetization until a breach, scandal, or lawsuit forces a course correction. As AI systems become more embedded in finance, health, employment, and daily life, many experts warn that U.S. law is **not fully equipped to prevent privacy harms** before they occur ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=lawmakers%20are%20increasingly%20arguing%20that,esque%20law)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=personal%20data%20for%20training%20purposes,and%20harms%20we%20discussed%20above)).

## European Union: Data Protection Strengths and Shortfalls  
Compared to the U.S., the EU has much **stronger privacy laws on paper**, but it faces its own challenges in practice. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**), in effect since 2018, set a **global benchmark for data protection**. The GDPR recognizes individuals’ rights over their personal data and imposes principles like **data minimization** (only collect what is necessary) and **purpose limitation** (use data only for specified purposes) that directly constrain how companies can gather and use data – including for AI training ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=Both%20the%20CCPA%20and%20the,how%20much%20personal%20information%20is)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=limiting%20the%20personal%20data%20that,sufficient%20for%20tackling%20the%20privacy)). In theory, these rules **should limit “unfettered personal data collection (or data mining) that is common for data-intensive AI”** ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=,intensive%20AI%C2%A0applications)). The GDPR also provides for hefty penalties (up to 4% of global turnover) for violations, raising expectations of strong enforcement. 

**In practice, the GDPR has led to some major enforcement actions** – especially against Big Tech companies whose business models rely on extensive data monetization. Data protection authorities in the EU have levied **record fines** for privacy infringements: for example, *Amazon* was fined €746–€877 million in 2021 (record-setting at the time) over targeted advertising practices violating GDPR’s consent rules ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=The%20list%20of%20GDPR%20violations,British%20Airways%29%2C%20Energy)). *Meta (Facebook)* has accumulated a long list of GDPR penalties – including a €225 million fine to its WhatsApp unit for inadequate transparency about data practices ([
            Is GDPR failing? a tale of the many challenges in interpretations, applications, and enforcement - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=million%20Euros%20in%202021%20for,The%20list)), and more recently a **record €1.2 billion fine** for continuing to transfer EU user data to the U.S. despite the invalidation of Privacy Shield ([1.2 billion euro fine for Facebook as a result of EDPB binding decision | European Data Protection Board](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en#:~:text=Brussels%2C%2022%20May%20,into%20compliance%20with%20the%20GDPR)). *Google* has likewise faced multiple fines (e.g. €50 million by France’s CNIL for opaque consent flows, and €90 million for YouTube’s cookie violations) ([
            Is GDPR failing? a tale of the many challenges in interpretations, applications, and enforcement - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=million%20Euros%20in%202021%20for,the%20rulings%20and%20penalties%20for)). Even outside Big Tech, GDPR enforcement has touched other sectors – from airlines (British Airways) to telecoms (several EU phone carriers) and even government agencies (e.g. the Dutch tax authority) found mishandling personal data ([
            Is GDPR failing? a tale of the many challenges in interpretations, applications, and enforcement - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=million%20Euros,the%20rulings%20and%20penalties%20for)). These actions suggest a robust regulatory response on paper. **Headline-grabbing fines** have certainly put companies on notice and, in some cases, forced changes in practices.

However, the **effectiveness of EU enforcement has been mixed**, leading critics to argue that **policy shortcomings undermine the GDPR’s promise**. One issue is **slow and uneven enforcement**. Many major cases take years to investigate and litigate, during which time the offending data practices may continue. There is often a considerable lag between complaints and rulings ([
            Is GDPR failing? a tale of the many challenges in interpretations, applications, and enforcement - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=such%20as%20Google%20or%20Meta%2C,7)). For instance, numerous complaints filed by privacy activists (such as noyb.eu) remain unresolved years later, as regulators in Ireland or Luxembourg (where many tech firms have their EU headquarters) deliberate. **Big firms with vast legal resources have been able to delay procedures** and appeal decisions, blunting the impact of enforcement ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20especially%20large%20actors%20with,the%20GDPR%20while%20exacerbating%20harm)). Civil society groups point out that while large fines make headlines, **in some instances companies haven’t even paid them promptly** due to ongoing appeals ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20especially%20large%20actors%20with,the%20GDPR%20while%20exacerbating%20harm)). This **lack of immediate consequences** can mean that companies continue business as usual, effectively **evading full accountability** and treating fines as negotiable penalties. Indeed, for trillion-dollar tech giants, even tens or hundreds of millions of euros in fines may be just a small fraction of annual revenue – *“for a large company such as Google or Meta, the fines are just so small,”* relative to their earnings ([
            Is GDPR failing? a tale of the many challenges in interpretations, applications, and enforcement - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=the%20largest%20being%20for%2090,7)). 

Another shortfall has been **enforcement coordination** in cross-border cases. The GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism means a company is usually regulated by the data authority in its main EU country, which can lead to bottlenecks. For example, the Irish Data Protection Commission has been criticized for slow handling of cases involving Facebook, Instagram, and others, requiring interventions by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to push for tougher action (as happened with the €1.2 billion Meta fine in 2023) ([1.2 billion euro fine for Facebook as a result of EDPB binding decision | European Data Protection Board](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en#:~:text=Brussels%2C%2022%20May%20,into%20compliance%20with%20the%20GDPR)) ([1.2 billion euro fine for Facebook as a result of EDPB binding decision | European Data Protection Board](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en#:~:text=Andrea%20Jelinek%2C%20EDPB%20Chair%2C%20said%3A,reaching%20consequences.%E2%80%9D)). This reveals a procedural gap: **if one national regulator is reticent or under-resourced, enforcement across the EU can stall**. In response, the EU is considering a *GDPR Procedural Regulation* to streamline cross-border enforcement, as advocacy groups are urging ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=We%2C%20the%20undersigned%20civil%20society,standing%20enforcement%20challenges%20effectively)) ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20a%20new,%E2%80%99)). Without such improvements, even the best-crafted privacy law can **fall short in practice**, allowing corporations to operate with “practical impunity” despite the rules on the books ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20a%20new,%E2%80%99)).

Despite these challenges, the EU has shown a willingness to confront **AI-specific data abuses** within its existing legal framework. A notable example is the case of **Clearview AI**. European regulators swiftly reacted to Clearview’s AI-driven face scanning: Data protection authorities in multiple countries found that Clearview’s scraping of social media photos for facial recognition **violated GDPR in gross terms**, and they **banned the service in Europe** ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=46%20Clearview%20has%20virtually%20been,the%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union)). The UK’s ICO and Italy’s DPA each fined Clearview (≈£7.5 million and €20 million respectively) and ordered it to delete EU residents’ data ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=These%20weren%E2%80%99t%20novel%20concerns,But%20given%20Clearview%E2%80%99s)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=46%20Clearview%20has%20virtually%20been,the%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union)). These actions have **“virtually shut out” Clearview from the EU market** ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=46%20Clearview%20has%20virtually%20been,the%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union)), showing that *GDPR can be wielded against AI-driven privacy infringements*. European regulators have also not shied away from confronting mainstream AI services: In March 2023, Italy’s Garante (data protection authority) **temporarily banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT** over privacy concerns. The Garante found that ChatGPT was **collecting users’ conversations and payment info to train its AI model without a legal basis**, in breach of GDPR ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=user%20data,model%2C%20to%20address%20concerns%20that)). It demanded OpenAI implement disclosures and age checks, and gave the company one month to comply or face a €20 million fine ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=model%20unlawful%20under%20the%20GDPR,57)). Within weeks, OpenAI responded with new privacy controls and the service was reinstated in Italy, indicating that regulators *can* spur changes in AI platform practices. The swift action on ChatGPT was a stark contrast to slower-moving cases and **signaled that EU authorities are willing to use existing laws to tackle emerging AI privacy issues**.

**Key EU Privacy Enforcement Examples:**  
- **Facebook/Cambridge Analytica (2018):** Before GDPR took effect, the UK ICO fined Facebook £500,000 (the legal maximum then) for failing to protect user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal ([Facebook to be fined £500,000 in Cambridge Analytica data scandal – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-cambridge-analytica-fine-ico-information-commissioner-elizabether-denham-brexit/#:~:text=,she%20added)). While largely symbolic (a *“rounding error”* next to Facebook’s profits ([Facebook to be fined £500,000 in Cambridge Analytica data scandal – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-cambridge-analytica-fine-ico-information-commissioner-elizabether-denham-brexit/#:~:text=,she%20added))), it underscored Facebook’s legal violations and foreshadowed the GDPR era of bigger fines.  
- **Amazon (Luxembourg, 2021):** Fined €746 million (GDPR’s largest fine at the time) for violating data protection rules in its behavioral advertising practices ([

- **Meta (Ireland, 2021–2023):** WhatsApp fined €225 million for transparency failures ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441646/#:~:text=million%20Euros%20in%202021%20for,The%20list)); Instagram fined €405 million for mishandling minors’ data (2022); Facebook hit with **€1.2 billion** in 2023 for illegal EU-to-US data transfers ([1.2 billion euro fine for Facebook as a result of EDPB binding decision | European Data Protection Board](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en#:~:text=Brussels%2C%2022%20May%20,into%20compliance%20with%20the%20GDPR)). These actions target Meta’s core data flows and highlight ongoing **compliance failures despite prior warnings**.  
- **Clearview AI (various EU states, 2022):** Banned and fined by multiple regulators for scraping Europeans’ photos from the web and deploying facial recognition without consent. Clearview’s practices were deemed a **“gross violation” of GDPR** and the company was forced to stop all processing of EU personal data ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=46%20Clearview%20has%20virtually%20been,the%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union)).  
- **OpenAI’s ChatGPT (Italy, 2023):** Ordered to cease processing Italian users’ data after a rapid investigation found unlawful data collection for AI training ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=user%20data,model%2C%20to%20address%20concerns%20that)). The ban was lifted once OpenAI implemented GDPR compliance measures. This case showed GDPR’s **flexibility to address novel AI services**, but also pointed out ambiguity around using public data to train AI models (an area policymakers are now examining ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=specific%20practices%20in%20place%20,do%20not%20need%20consent%20for)) ([](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/White-Paper-Rethinking-Privacy-AI-Era.pdf#:~:text=scraped%20data%20raises%20questions%20about,51%20Generative%20systems%20raise))).

Overall, the EU’s approach demonstrates *stronger privacy rules* and the will to enforce them, but also reveals **policy shortcomings in enforcement**. The existence of GDPR (and related laws like the ePrivacy directive) provides a robust framework to tackle many AI-driven data risks – from requiring a legal basis for data processing, to giving users rights over automated profiling. Yet, **if enforcement is slow, inconsistent, or weak, the deterrent effect is diluted**. European policymakers recognize these challenges: efforts are underway to **streamline GDPR enforcement and close loopholes** that allow stalling tactics ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20especially%20large%20actors%20with,the%20GDPR%20while%20exacerbating%20harm)) ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=This%20is%20not%20a%20new,%E2%80%99)). Additionally, the EU is developing **AI-specific regulations (the AI Act)** to address risks that go beyond personal data, such as algorithmic transparency and bans on certain high-risk AI uses (e.g. mass biometric surveillance). But even the best policies need vigorous implementation. As it stands, gaps in enforcement capacity and cross-border coordination remain a hurdle in fully **protecting consumers from AI-driven privacy violations** in the EU.

## Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Stronger Privacy Governance  
The rise of AI-driven data collection has exposed significant **shortcomings in current privacy policies and enforcement** on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., a lack of a comprehensive privacy law means much data monetization occurs in a legal grey zone, checked only by after-the-fact enforcement or state-level rules. In the EU, a comprehensive law (GDPR) exists and has yielded large fines, but enforcement has not kept up with Big Tech’s scale and speed, leading to delays and sometimes only symbolic consequences. **Cambridge Analytica and the Snowden revelations were cautionary tales** that demonstrated how personal data misuse – whether by private firms or government agencies – can undermine democratic institutions and individual freedoms. Today’s AI technologies amplify those risks by enabling more intrusive data analysis and targeting, yet our **policy responses have been lagging and fragmented**.

The evidence shows a pattern of **enforcement failures and slow reactions**: scandals are often what spur regulators into action, rather than proactive oversight preventing harm in the first place. Companies that control vast datasets have at times **“systematically undermined data protection” principles ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=to%20safeguard%20peoples%E2%80%99%20fundamental%20rights,EU%20Treaties%20and%20the%20Charter))**, staying a step ahead of rules. When penalties do arrive, they can be delayed for years and may not significantly dent the profits reaped from questionable data practices ([Now or never: strengthen GDPR Procedural Rules to hold Big Tech accountable ](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/strengthen-gdpr-procedural-rules/#:~:text=Yet%2C%20especially%20large%20actors%20with,the%20GDPR%20while%20exacerbating%20harm)). This reality calls for closing the gap between policy and practice. That means not only updating laws to address **AI-specific privacy challenges** (such as automated inference of sensitive traits, large-scale public data scraping, and algorithmic decision-making that affects individuals), but also **ensuring robust enforcement** of those laws.

Without stronger **privacy safeguards, oversight, and accountability**, AI-driven data collection will continue to outpace our ability to protect consumers. The **contemporary risks mirror those seen in Cambridge Analytica and Snowden’s time** – indiscriminate data harvesting, opaque monetization of personal information, and potential abuse by both corporations and states – but on a far larger scale powered by AI. Bridging the gap will likely require: clearer rules on permissible data uses (and firm bans on the most dangerous practices), greater transparency from companies about their AI data processing, empowered regulators with the resources to act quickly, and international cooperation (especially between the U.S. and EU) to address cross-border data flows and surveillance. Until such policy measures are firmly in place, **consumer privacy will remain vulnerable** to exploitation in the age of AI – an era where data has truly become power, and where guarding privacy is essential to preserving individual rights and trust in the digital ecosystem.

# AI-Driven Surveillance Risks: Impactful Quotes (2019–Present)

## Surveillance Capitalism and Corporate Data Exploitation (U.S. Perspective)

> “Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.”\
> **– Shoshana Zuboff, *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* (2019)【54†L159-L162】**

> “Large tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google also pursued major military and surveillance contracts, further enmeshing those interests… Across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, multiple governments continue to roll out biometric ID projects that create the infrastructure for both state and commercial surveillance. Yet few regulatory regimes govern this intersection. We need strong transparency, accountability, and oversight in these areas.”\
> **– AI Now Institute, *2019 Report*【12†L353-L360】【12†L360-L364】**

> “The case against Facebook is about more than just privacy – it is also about the power to control and manipulate. Global regulators and policymakers need to confront the dangers associated with mass surveillance and the resulting ability to control and influence us. The behavioral advertising business incentives of technology platforms spur practices that are dividing our society. The harm from this conduct is immeasurable, and regulators and policymakers must confront it.”\
> **– Rohit Chopra, U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner (Dissenting Statement on Facebook), 2019【56†L73-L81】**

## Policy and Enforcement Failures (EU Perspective)

> “After nearly one and a half year we must concede that we have a huge problem with the enforcement of cross-border processing especially by globally acting companies… It is absolutely unsatisfactory to see that the biggest alleged data protection violations of the last 15 months with millions of individuals concerned are far away from being sanctioned.”\
> **– Spokesperson, Hamburg Data Protection Authority (Germany), quoted in Politico (2019)【22†L197-L203】**

> “The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and Supervisor (EDPS) **claim a ban \[on facial recognition in public spaces] is needed if we want to preserve our freedoms and create a human-centric legal framework for AI**.”\
> **– Joint statement by EU privacy watchdogs (2021)【53†L80-L87】**

## Authoritarian Surveillance and Social Control (China Perspective)

> “What is even more striking is Beijing’s establishment there of a **surveillance state**, which plays a central role in determining who will be detained. The scope and intrusiveness of this effort may well be unprecedented. If this new form of totalitarianism is not curtailed, it portends a dystopia that other governments can be expected to emulate, **threatening us all**.”\
> **– Human Rights Watch report on Xinjiang (Kenneth Roth & Maya Wang, 2019)【32†L575-L580】**

Each of these quotes – drawn from academic research, official reports, and expert analyses – highlights the **global risks of AI-driven surveillance**. They underscore how corporate **data exploitation** and inadequate policy **enforcement** have enabled a new era of “surveillance capitalism,” the challenges regulators face in reining in Big Tech, and the extreme case of state surveillance in China. Together, they paint a thought-provoking picture of why stronger oversight and legal safeguards are urgently needed to protect privacy, autonomy, and democracy in the age of AI.
