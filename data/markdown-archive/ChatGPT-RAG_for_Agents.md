# RAG for Agents

#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-22T06:32:28.408Z" title="1/22/2025, 3:32:28 PM">15:32</time>

this python script mostly works exept for the get_title_and_summary function. this results in a 404 and thus does not produce a title or summary. here is the python script and the latest ollama docs. what is wrong?

API
Endpoints

    Generate a completion
    Generate a chat completion
    Create a Model
    List Local Models
    Show Model Information
    Copy a Model

Conventions
Model names

Model names follow a model:tag format, where model can have an optional namespace such as example/model. Some examples are orca-mini:3b-q4_1 and llama3:70b. The tag is optional and, if not provided, will default to latest. The tag is used to identify a specific version.
Durations

All durations are returned in nanoseconds.
Streaming responses

Certain endpoints stream responses as JSON objects. Streaming can be disabled by providing {"stream": false} for these endpoints.
Generate a completion

POST /api/generate

Generate a response for a given prompt with a provided model. This is a streaming endpoint, so there will be a series of responses. The final response object will include statistics and additional data from the request.
Parameters

    model: (required) the model name
    prompt: the prompt to generate a response for
    suffix: the text after the model response
    images: (optional) a list of base64-encoded images (for multimodal models such as llava)

Advanced parameters (optional):

    format: the format to return a response in. Format can be json or a JSON schema
    options: additional model parameters listed in the documentation for the Modelfile such as temperature
    system: system message to (overrides what is defined in the Modelfile)
    template: the prompt template to use (overrides what is defined in the Modelfile)
    stream: if false the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects
    raw: if true no formatting will be applied to the prompt. You may choose to use the raw parameter if you are specifying a full templated prompt in your request to the API
    keep_alive: controls how long the model will stay loaded into memory following the request (default: 5m)
    context (deprecated): the context parameter returned from a previous request to /generate, this can be used to keep a short conversational memory

Structured outputs

Structured outputs are supported by providing a JSON schema in the format parameter. The model will generate a response that matches the schema. See the structured outputs example below.
JSON mode

Enable JSON mode by setting the format parameter to json. This will structure the response as a valid JSON object. See the JSON mode example below.

Important

It's important to instruct the model to use JSON in the prompt. Otherwise, the model may generate large amounts whitespace.
Examples
Generate request (Streaming)
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?"
}'

Response

A stream of JSON objects is returned:

{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "created_at": "2023-08-04T08:52:19.385406455-07:00",
  "response": "The",
  "done": false
}

The final response in the stream also includes additional data about the generation:

    total_duration: time spent generating the response
    load_duration: time spent in nanoseconds loading the model
    prompt_eval_count: number of tokens in the prompt
    prompt_eval_duration: time spent in nanoseconds evaluating the prompt
    eval_count: number of tokens in the response
    eval_duration: time in nanoseconds spent generating the response
    context: an encoding of the conversation used in this response, this can be sent in the next request to keep a conversational memory
    response: empty if the response was streamed, if not streamed, this will contain the full response

To calculate how fast the response is generated in tokens per second (token/s), divide eval_count / eval_duration * 10^9.

{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "created_at": "2023-08-04T19:22:45.499127Z",
  "response": "",
  "done": true,
  "context": [1, 2, 3],

  "prompt_eval_duration": 130079000,
  "eval_count": 259,
  "eval_duration": 4232710000
}

Request (No streaming)
Request

A response can be received in one reply when streaming is off.

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
  "stream": false
}'

Response

If stream is set to false, the response will be a single JSON object:

{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "created_at": "2023-08-04T19:22:45.499127Z",
  "response": "The sky is blue because it is the color of the sky.",
  "done": true,
  "context": [1, 2, 3],
  "total_duration": 5043500667,
  "load_duration": 5025959,
  "prompt_eval_count": 26,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 325953000,
  "eval_count": 290,
  "eval_duration": 4709213000
}

Request (with suffix)
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "codellama:code",
  "prompt": "def compute_gcd(a, b):",
  "suffix": "    return result",
  "options": {
    "temperature": 0
  },
  "stream": false
}'

Response

{
  "model": "codellama:code",
  "created_at": "2024-07-22T20:47:51.147561Z",
  "response": "\n  if a == 0:\n    return b\n  else:\n    return compute_gcd(b % a, a)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n  result = (a * b) / compute_gcd(a, b)\n",
  "done": true,
  "done_reason": "stop",
  "context": [...],
  "total_duration": 1162761250,
  "load_duration": 6683708,
  "prompt_eval_count": 17,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 201222000,
  "eval_count": 63,
  "eval_duration": 953997000
}

Request (Structured outputs)
Request

curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "llama3.1:8b",
  "prompt": "Ollama is 22 years old and is busy saving the world. Respond using JSON",
  "stream": false,
  "format": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "age": {
        "type": "integer"
      },

    },
    "required": [
      "age",
      "available"
    ]
  }
}'

Response

  "model": "llama3.1:8b",
  "created_at": "2024-12-06T00:48:09.983619Z",
  "response": "{\n  \"age\": 22,\n  \"available\": true\n}",
  "done": true,
  "done_reason": "stop",
  "context": [1, 2, 3],
  "total_duration": 1075509083,
  "load_duration": 567678166,
  "prompt_eval_count": 28,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 236000000,
  "eval_count": 16,
  "eval_duration": 269000000
}

Request (JSON mode)

Important

When format is set to json, the output will always be a well-formed JSON object. It's important to also instruct the model to respond in JSON.
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "prompt": "What color is the sky at different times of the day? Respond using JSON",
  "format": "json",
  "stream": false
}'

Response

{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "created_at": "2023-11-09T21:07:55.186497Z",
  "response": "{\n\"morning\": {\n\"color\": \"blue\"\n},\n\"noon\": {\n\"color\": \"blue-gray\"\n},\n\"afternoon\": {\n\"color\": \"warm gray\"\n},\n\"evening\": {\n\"color\": \"orange\"\n}\n}\n",
  "done": true,
  "context": [1, 2, 3],
  "total_duration": 4648158584,
  "load_duration": 4071084,
  "prompt_eval_count": 36,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 439038000,
  "eval_count": 180,
  "eval_duration": 4196918000
}

The value of response will be a string containing JSON similar to:

{
  "morning": {
    "color": "blue"
  },
  "noon": {
    "color": "blue-gray"
  },
  "afternoon": {
    "color": "warm gray"
  },
  "evening": {
    "color": "orange"
  }
}

Request (with images)

To submit images to multimodal models such as llava or bakllava, provide a list of base64-encoded images:
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llava",

  "response": "",
  "done": true
}

Unload a model

If an empty prompt is provided and the keep_alive parameter is set to 0, a model will be unloaded from memory.
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "keep_alive": 0

Generate a chat completion

POST /api/chat

Generate the next message in a chat with a provided model. This is a streaming endpoint, so there will be a series of responses. Streaming can be disabled using "stream": false. The final response object will include statistics and additional data from the request.
Parameters

    model: (required) the model name
    messages: the messages of the chat, this can be used to keep a chat memory
    tools: tools for the model to use if supported. Requires stream to be set to false

The message object has the following fields:

    role: the role of the message, either system, user, assistant, or tool
    content: the content of the message
    images (optional): a list of images to include in the message (for multimodal models such as llava)
    tool_calls (optional): a list of tools the model wants to use

Advanced parameters (optional):

    format: the format to return a response in. Format can be json or a JSON schema.
    options: additional model parameters listed in the documentation for the Modelfile such as temperature
    stream: if false the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects
    keep_alive: controls how long the model will stay loaded into memory following the request (default: 5m)

Structured outputs

Structured outputs are supported by providing a JSON schema in the format parameter. The model will generate a response that matches the schema. See the Chat request (Structured outputs) example below.

Parameters

    model: name of the model to create
    from: (optional) name of an existing model to create the new model from
    files: (optional) a dictionary of file names to SHA256 digests of blobs to create the model from
    adapters: (optional) a dictionary of file names to SHA256 digests of blobs for LORA adapters
    template: (optional) the prompt template for the model
    license: (optional) a string or list of strings containing the license or licenses for the model
    system: (optional) a string containing the system prompt for the model
    parameters: (optional) a dictionary of parameters for the model (see Modelfile for a list of parameters)
    messages: (optional) a list of message objects used to create a conversation
    stream: (optional) if false the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects
    quantize (optional): quantize a non-quantized (e.g. float16) model

Pull a Model

POST /api/pull

Download a model from the ollama library. Cancelled pulls are resumed from where they left off, and multiple calls will share the same download progress.
Parameters

    model: name of the model to pull
    insecure: (optional) allow insecure connections to the library. Only use this if you are pulling from your own library during development.
    stream: (optional) if false the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects

Examples
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{
  "model": "llama3.2"
}'

Response

If stream is not specified, or set to true, a stream of JSON objects is returned:

The first object is the manifest:

{
  "status": "pulling manifest"
}

Then there is a series of downloading responses. Until any of the download is completed, the completed key may not be included. The number of files to be downloaded depends on the number of layers specified in the manifest.

{
  "status": "downloading digestname",
  "digest": "digestname",
  "total": 2142590208,
  "completed": 241970
}

After all the files are downloaded, the final responses are:

{
    "status": "verifying sha256 digest"
}
{
    "status": "writing manifest"
}
{
    "status": "removing any unused layers"
}
{
    "status": "success"
}

if stream is set to false, then the response is a single JSON object:

{
  "status": "success"
}

Push a Model

POST /api/push

Upload a model to a model library. Requires registering for ollama.ai and adding a public key first.
Parameters

    model: name of the model to push in the form of <namespace>/<model>:<tag>
    insecure: (optional) allow insecure connections to the library. Only use this if you are pushing to your library during development.
    stream: (optional) if false the response will be returned as a single response object, rather than a stream of objects

Examples
Request

curl http://localhost:11434/api/push -d '{
  "model": "mattw/pygmalion:latest"
}'

Response

If stream is not specified, or set to true, a stream of JSON objects is returned:

{ "status": "retrieving manifest" }

and then:

{
  "status": "starting upload",
  "digest": "sha256:bc07c81de745696fdf5afca05e065818a8149fb0c77266fb584d9b2cba3711ab",
  "total": 1928429856
}

Then there is a series of uploading responses:

{
  "status": "starting upload",
  "digest": "sha256:bc07c81de745696fdf5afca05e065818a8149fb0c77266fb584d9b2cba3711ab",
  "total": 1928429856
}

Finally, when the upload is complete:

{"status":"pushing manifest"}
{"status":"success"}

If stream is set to false, then the response is a single JSON object:

{ "status": "success" }

From the Ollama docs, a 404 usually indicates that the requested model name doesn’t exist on the server at all. In your code:

```python
"model": "llama3.2:1b",
```

That model name (`llama3.2:1b`) is almost certainly causing the 404. Ollama is telling you “Not Found” because it cannot find a local model named `llama3.2:1b`.

If you check the Ollama docs or run `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`, you’ll see the names and tags of models you actually have available. They typically look like one of these:

- `llama3.2`
- `llama3:70b`
- `codellama:code`
- `orca-mini:3b-q4_1`

But `llama3.2:1b` is not a recognized name/tag. Simply pick a real, valid model name (one you’ve pulled or that ships with Ollama) and update your request. For example:

```python
"model": "llama3.2",
```

or

```python
"model": "llama2:7b",
```

depending on which one you actually have. Once the model name is corrected to something Ollama can find locally, the `POST /api/generate` call should respond with 200 instead of 404, and your `get_title_and_summary()` function will begin returning the expected text.

---

### Quick Check

1. **List local models**\
   Run:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```
   See what models show up under `"models": [...]`. Use one of those names in your Python code.

2. **Pull a model**\
   If you haven’t pulled any model yet, use:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{"model":"llama3.2"}'
   ```
   Or whichever model you want. Confirm that it completes successfully.

3. **Update your script**\
   Change:
   ```python
   json={
     "model": "llama3.2:1b",
     ...
   }
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   json={
     "model": "llama3.2",
     ...
   }
   ```
   (or a valid name/tag you actually have). That should fix the 404 and let your title/summary requests work correctly.

<time datetime="2025-01-22T06:37:58.664Z" title="1/22/2025, 3:37:58 PM">15:37</time>

Since `GET /api/tags` shows an empty list (`{"models":[]}`), that means Ollama has **no models** currently installed on your system. Consequently, any request like

```json
{
  "model": "llama3.2",
  "prompt": "Extract a title and summary..."
}
```

will return a 404, because Ollama can’t find a local model with that name.

---

## How to Fix

1. **Pull a Model**\
   First, you need to actually download a model to Ollama. For example, to pull the standard Llama 2 7B Chat model from the Ollama library, run:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{"model":"llama2:7b"}'
   ```
   Wait for it to finish pulling all the layers.

2. **Verify the Model is Installed**\
   Re-run:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```
   You should now see `"llama2:7b"` (or whichever name you pulled) in the returned JSON.

3. **Update Your Python Code**\
   In `get_title_and_summary()`, change this part:

   ```python
   resp = await client.post(
       "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
       json={
           "model": "llama3.2:1b",  # or some name that doesn't exist
           "prompt": prompt_text,
           ...
       }
   )
   ```

   to use the model that you actually installed, e.g.:

   ```python
   resp = await client.post(
       "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
       json={
           "model": "llama2:7b",   # or whichever model name you see in /api/tags
           "prompt": prompt_text,
           "stream": False,
           "options": {
               "temperature": 0.7,
               "num_predict": 512
           }
       },
       timeout=300.0
   )
   ```

4. **Re-run the Script**\
   Now Ollama will recognize the model name, and you should get a 200 response with your generated title and summary.

---

### Common Pitfalls

- **No models installed.** Ollama ships “empty” and requires you to pull a model. The 404 error is just Ollama telling you “I can’t find that model locally.”
- **Incorrect model name.** Even if a model is installed, a typo or wrong tag (e.g. `"llama3.2:1b"`) will 404.
- **Licensing / Access issues.** Some models require an Llama 2 license acceptance. Ollama’s logs may show if it was unable to pull for licensing reasons.

Once you pull a valid model and update the `"model"` field to match that exact local name, `get_title_and_summary()` will work.

<time datetime="2025-01-22T06:39:17.036Z" title="1/22/2025, 3:39:17 PM">15:39</time>

Yes. Ollama only works with models that are installed locally, so you do need to download at least one model before making a `POST /api/generate` or `POST /api/chat` call.

Ollama doesn’t automatically fetch any models by default. You have to explicitly pull a model first—something like:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{"model":"llama2:7b"}'
```

That will download the `llama2:7b` model files and make it available locally. Then you can confirm it’s installed by running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

and seeing `"llama2:7b"` in the returned list. Once you see it, you can reference `"llama2:7b"` in your Python code as the `"model"` parameter.

Here's a simple way to have systemd automatically pull the `llama3.2:1b` model *before* starting Ollama:

1. **Add** an `ExecStartPre` line to run `ollama pull llama3.2:1b`
2. **Keep** your original `ExecStart` line for `ollama serve`

Your `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service` might look like this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Ollama Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ashwin
Environment="HOME=/home/ashwin"
# Pull the llama3.2:1b model before starting the server
ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Explanation

- **ExecStartPre** is a systemd directive that runs *before* the main `ExecStart` command. If it fails (e.g., if it can’t pull the model), the service won’t start.
- `ollama pull llama3.2:1b` directly tells the `ollama` CLI to retrieve that model from the public library. If it’s already downloaded, it should quickly verify and then proceed.
- After that completes, systemd runs your main `ollama serve` command, ensuring the model is already present.

Finally, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ollama
sudo systemctl start ollama
```

Then check logs:

```bash
journalctl -u ollama -f
```

You should see systemd pulling `llama3.2:1b` and then starting the Ollama server.

Those 404 errors mean Ollama can’t find the requested model name on your server. Specifically, your code is calling:

```python
json={
  "model": "llama3.2:1b",
  "prompt": ...
}
```

But Ollama is returning “Not Found,” so it has **no** model named `llama3.2:1b` locally. To fix this:

1. **Pull a Valid Model**\
   Either pull a model that Ollama actually hosts or has in its library. For example, if you want some Llama 2 variant:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{"model":"llama2:7b"}'
   ```
   Wait for it to finish. Verify by running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```
   You should see `"llama2:7b"` in the output.

2. **Use That Same Name in Your Script**\
   In `get_title_and_summary()`, change:
   ```python
   "model": "llama3.2:1b",
   ```
   to the model name you actually pulled, e.g.:
   ```python
   "model": "llama2:7b",
   ```

3. **Or** if you really want `llama3.2:1b`…
   - Make sure Ollama actually *has* that variant in its library. You can try:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{"model":"llama3.2:1b"}'
     ```
     If Ollama returns an error that it can’t find that model, then you’ll need to pick a different one.

**Bottom line:** You must pull a specific model so that `"model"` in your Python code matches a model name that actually appears when you run `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`. Otherwise, Ollama will 404 because it literally can’t find the model you’re asking for. Once you match the names, the 404s will go away.

<time datetime="2025-01-22T06:45:52.376Z" title="1/22/2025, 3:45:52 PM">15:45</time>

Based on that page’s instructions (`ollama run llama3.2:1b`), **yes**, the canonical name/tag for the 1B parameter version of “Llama 3.2” appears to be:

```
llama3.2:1b
```

However, Ollama can only serve models that are actually installed locally. So if you see 404 errors when specifying `"model": "llama3.2:1b"`, it usually means that model hasn’t been **pulled** (downloaded) onto your machine yet.

---

## How to Confirm & Pull It

1. **Try listing local models**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```
   - If the output is `{"models":[]}`, it means no models are installed locally.

2. **Pull Llama 3.2 (1B) explicitly**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/pull -d '{"model":"llama3.2:1b"}'
   ```
   Wait for the pull to complete (it will download around 1.3GB).

3. **List local models again**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```
   Make sure `"llama3.2:1b"` is now present in the `"models"` array.

4. **Update your Python code**\
   Confirm your `POST /api/generate` call has:
   ```python
   json={
       "model": "llama3.2:1b",
       "prompt": ...
       ...
   }
   ```
   That should now work without 404, assuming Ollama sees `"llama3.2:1b"` in `tags`.

---

### Summary

- The **name** is correct: `llama3.2:1b`.
- You **must** run `ollama pull llama3.2:1b` first so that Ollama actually has it installed.
- Once installed, referencing `"llama3.2:1b"` in your code will succeed (no more 404).

That error just means you don’t have `asyncpg` installed in your Python environment. You can install it with:

```bash
pip3 install asyncpg
```

or

```bash
python3 -m pip install asyncpg
```

Once that completes successfully, re-run your script and the `asyncpg` module error should go away.

all of the package are installed via miniconda3 but i don't always remember to activate my venv before running the script. is there some way to automatically start that venv on script start?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-22T06:50:40.569Z" title="1/22/2025, 3:50:40 PM">15:50</time>

A convenient way to handle this is to create a small “launcher” (shell script or systemd service, etc.) that does:

1. Activates your conda environment, and then
2. Runs your Python script.

That way you can always just run the launcher, and it will automatically be in the correct environment without you having to remember.

---

## Example Bash launcher script

Suppose you have a conda environment called `myenv`. You can create a file called `run_crawl.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Make sure conda is available
source /path/to/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

# Activate your environment
conda activate myenv

# Run your Python script
python /path/to/crawl.py
```

Give it execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x run_crawl.sh
```

Now any time you do:

```bash
./run_crawl.sh
```

it will automatically activate `myenv` and then run your script. This prevents the “forgetting to activate venv” issue.

---

## Using `conda run`

Another option is to prefix your command with [**conda run**](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/commands/run.html):

```bash
conda run -n myenv python /path/to/crawl.py
```

This ensures it executes inside the `myenv` environment without having to source or activate anything first.

---

## Within a systemd service

If you’re running this via systemd, you can similarly source the conda script and then activate your environment in `ExecStartPre` or the main `ExecStart`:

```ini
[Service]
Type=simple
User=ashwin
# Adjust the path to your conda.sh
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'source /path/to/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate myenv'
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'source /path/to/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate myenv && python /path/to/crawl.py'
```

**Key idea**: conda activation is just a shell function, so you have to load it in a shell context (e.g., `ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "..."`).

---

### Summary

- **Create a wrapper script** that activates your conda environment, then runs your Python script.
- **Or** use `conda run -n myenv python yourscript.py` directly.
- **Or** in a systemd service, call `source <conda.sh> && conda activate <env>` in the command.

Below are **two** files you can create:

1. A **launcher script** in the project root that automatically activates your `crawl4ai` Conda environment and runs `crawl.py`.
2. A **systemd service file** that points to that script, so you can run the crawler at system startup.

---

## 1) Launcher Script

Save this as **`run_crawler.sh`** in the root of your project (`/home/ashwin/crawl4ai/run_crawler.sh` for example):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

# 1. Make Conda available in this shell
source /home/ashwin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

# 2. Activate the 'crawl4ai' conda environment
conda activate crawl4ai

# 3. Change to the project root (if needed)
cd /home/ashwin/crawl4ai

# 4. Run your crawler script
python src/crawl.py
```

- Make it executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /home/ashwin/crawl4ai/run_crawler.sh
  ```

---

## 2) Systemd Service File

Create a new file at **`/etc/systemd/system/crawl4ai.service`** with these contents:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=crawl4ai crawler service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ashwin
WorkingDirectory=/home/ashwin/crawl4ai
ExecStart=/home/ashwin/crawl4ai/run_crawler.sh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Key points**:

- `WorkingDirectory` is set to your project folder.
- `ExecStart` runs the launcher script that automatically enters your Conda env and executes the crawler.

---

### Enable and Start the Service

1. Reload systemd to pick up the new unit file:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
2. Enable the service so it starts on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable crawl4ai
   ```
3. Start it now:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start crawl4ai
   ```
4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u crawl4ai -f
   ```

You should see your environment activate and `python src/crawl.py` run automatically. From here on, whenever the system boots (or you manually start the service), it will use your `crawl4ai` environment without needing you to activate anything by hand.

<time datetime="2025-01-22T06:57:25.230Z" title="1/22/2025, 3:57:25 PM">15:57</time>

After you’ve saved the script **`run_crawler.sh`** in your project root and made it executable, you can start the crawler simply by running it directly:

1. **Make sure the script is executable**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ashwin/crawl4ai
   chmod +x run_crawler.sh
   ```

2. **Run the script** (from inside the same directory):
   ```bash
   ./run_crawler.sh
   ```
   That will:
   - Source your Conda setup
   - Activate the `crawl4ai` environment
   - Run `python src/crawl.py`

If the script is stored somewhere else, you can just use the full path:

```bash
bash /path/to/run_crawler.sh
```

or

```bash
/path/to/run_crawler.sh
```

(depending on how you set it up).

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-22T07:26:35.766Z" title="1/22/2025, 4:26:35 PM">16:26</time>

Right now, your code always sets the title to `"Extracted Title Placeholder"`. You never actually parse the model’s response for the title! You’re returning:

```python
return {
    "title": "Extracted Title Placeholder",
    "summary": full_text
}
```

So the `"summary"` is whatever the model returned, but the `"title"` is just a hard-coded string. That’s why the “title extraction” appears broken.

---

## How to Fix

You have two main options:

1. **Instruct the model to return JSON** with `"title"` and `"summary"` fields, then parse that JSON.
2. **Parse** whatever text the model returns, e.g., by looking for `"Title: ..."` and `"Summary: ..."` lines.

### 1) Use JSON Output

**Update your prompt** so the model returns valid JSON, for example:

```python
prompt_text = f"""Extract a short 'title' and a 'summary' from the chunk below. 
Please respond with valid JSON in the format:

{{
  "title": "...",
  "summary": "..."
}}

Chunk:
{chunk}
"""
```

Then in your `POST /api/generate` body, you can optionally set `"format": "json"`:

```python
resp = await client.post(
    "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
    json={
        "model": "llama3.2:1b",
        "prompt": prompt_text,
        "stream": False,
        "format": "json",             # optional, makes output always a valid JSON string
        "options": {
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "num_predict": 512
        }
    },
    timeout=300.0
)
```

Then **parse** the returned text as JSON:

```python
data = resp.json()  # top-level object from Ollama
full_text = data.get("response", "").strip()

# Now parse the full_text as JSON from the model
import json
try:
    parsed_json = json.loads(full_text)
    title = parsed_json.get("title", "")
    summary = parsed_json.get("summary", "")
except Exception:
    # Fallback: if the model didn’t produce valid JSON, 
    # handle gracefully
    title = ""
    summary = full_text

return {
    "title": title,
    "summary": summary
}
```

With these changes, you’ll get a true extracted title from the chunk, instead of a placeholder.

---

### 2) Parse the Plain Text

If you don’t want to do strict JSON, you could keep the model’s answer in a plain text format, e.g.:

```
Title: ...
Summary: ...
```

Then do something like:

```python
full_text = data.get("response", "").strip()
lines = full_text.splitlines()

title_line = None
summary_line = []
found_summary = False

for line in lines:
    if line.lower().startswith("title:"):
        title_line = line[len("title:"):].strip()
    elif line.lower().startswith("summary:"):
        found_summary = True
    elif found_summary:
        # everything after "Summary:" is summary
        summary_line.append(line)

return {
    "title": title_line or "No Title Found",
    "summary": "\n".join(summary_line).strip()
}
```

But JSON is usually easier to parse reliably, especially if you explicitly instruct the model to respond in a structured format.

---

## In Short

- You’re **hard-coding** `"Extracted Title Placeholder"`.
- Instruct the model to produce a real title, then **actually parse** that data out of the model’s response.
- The simplest method is to have the model return JSON with `"title"` and `"summary"` keys.

A good place to parse the model’s JSON response is **right inside** your `get_title_and_summary()` function, after you get the `full_text`. In other words, **replace**:

```python
return {
    "title": "Extracted Title Placeholder",
    "summary": full_text
}
```

with something that attempts to parse the JSON coming back from the model. For example:

```python
try:
    # Parse the full_text JSON
    parsed_output = json.loads(full_text)
    extracted_title = parsed_output.get("title", "No Title")
    extracted_summary = parsed_output.get("summary", "")
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # If it’s not valid JSON, just keep the raw text as 'summary'
    extracted_title = "Parsing Error"
    extracted_summary = full_text

return {
    "title": extracted_title,
    "summary": extracted_summary
}
```

### Updated `get_title_and_summary()` Example

```python
async def get_title_and_summary(chunk: str, url: str) -> dict:
    prompt_text = f"""Extract a short 'title' and a 'summary' from the chunk below.
    Please respond with valid JSON in the format:

    {{
      "title": "...",
      "summary": "..."
    }}

    Chunk:
    {chunk}
    """

    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            resp = await client.post(
                "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
                json={
                    "model": "llama3.2:1b",
                    "prompt": prompt_text,
                    "stream": False,
                    "format": "json"
                },
                timeout=300.0
            )
            resp.raise_for_status()
            data = resp.json()  # single JSON object from Ollama
            full_text = data.get("response", "").strip()

            # Attempt to parse the JSON that the model returns
            try:
                parsed_output = json.loads(full_text)
                extracted_title = parsed_output.get("title", "No Title")
                extracted_summary = parsed_output.get("summary", "")
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                # If the model didn't produce valid JSON, fallback to raw text
                extracted_title = "Parsing Error"
                extracted_summary = full_text

            return {
                "title": extracted_title,
                "summary": extracted_summary
            }

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error from Ollama: {e}")
        return {"title": "Error", "summary": "Error"}
```

### Why Inside `get_title_and_summary()`

- **Directly after** retrieving `full_text` is the best time to parse, because you have that data local and can decide how to handle JSON decoding errors.
- If you wanted a **separate** parser function, you could pass `full_text` to a function like `parse_title_summary(full_text)` and return the final dictionary. But typically it’s cleaner to keep it in one place since `get_title_and_summary()` is specifically about retrieving and parsing that response.

With these changes, you’ll get **actual** `"title"` and `"summary"` values from the model’s JSON, rather than a hard-coded placeholder.

Error inserting raw markdown page: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "crawl4ai_pages_page_url_unique"

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-22T07:31:05.579Z" title="1/22/2025, 4:31:05 PM">16:31</time>

That error occurs because your database schema requires `page_url` to be unique in the `crawl4ai_pages` table (the constraint name is `crawl4ai_pages_page_url_unique`). If your crawler tries to insert the **same URL** again, Postgres sees a duplicate key violation.

### Why This Happens

- You’ve already inserted a row for that URL, so a new `INSERT` with the same URL triggers the unique constraint error.

### How To Fix

You need to decide what you want to do when you encounter the *same* URL more than once:

1. **Ignore duplicates** (skip inserting rows if the URL already exists), or
2. **Update** the existing row with new data if the URL is already present, or
3. **Delete** the old row before inserting the new row, etc.

---

#### 1) Ignore Duplicates: “ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING”

If you just want to keep the *first* row that was inserted for each URL, and skip new inserts for that same URL, you can add **ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING** to your `INSERT`:

```sql
INSERT INTO crawl4ai_pages(page_url, raw_markdown, created_at, last_modified)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO NOTHING
```

In your Python code, that might look like:

```python
await conn.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO crawl4ai_pages (page_url, raw_markdown, created_at, last_modified)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
    ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO NOTHING
    """,
    page_url,
    raw_markdown,
    created_at_dt,
    last_modified_dt
)
```

**Note:** If the URL already exists, the insert is skipped—no error.

---

#### 2) Upsert: “ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE …”

If you want to **update** the existing row when you see the same URL again, you can do an *upsert*:

```sql
INSERT INTO crawl4ai_pages (page_url, raw_markdown, created_at, last_modified)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO UPDATE
  SET raw_markdown = EXCLUDED.raw_markdown,
      created_at   = EXCLUDED.created_at,
      last_modified= EXCLUDED.last_modified
```

Now, if the `page_url` already exists, that row gets updated with the new `raw_markdown`, `created_at`, and `last_modified` values. In code:

```python
await conn.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO crawl4ai_pages (page_url, raw_markdown, created_at, last_modified)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
    ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO UPDATE
        SET raw_markdown  = EXCLUDED.raw_markdown,
            created_at    = EXCLUDED.created_at,
            last_modified = EXCLUDED.last_modified
    """,
    page_url,
    raw_markdown,
    created_at_dt,
    last_modified_dt
)
```

---

### Which Approach Should You Choose?

- **DO NOTHING** if you only want one record per URL and don’t want to overwrite older data.
- **DO UPDATE** if you want to always keep the latest raw\_markdown, timestamps, etc. for a given URL.
- **Check first** if you want more custom logic, like only updating if the new `last_modified` is more recent.

---

### In Summary

That “duplicate key value violates unique constraint” error is just telling you “this URL is already in the table.” Add `ON CONFLICT` handling to either skip duplicates or update them. That way, you can handle repeated URLs gracefully without the script crashing.

Below is an updated version of your `process_chunk()` function that uses the domain (`netloc`) from the URL as the `"source"` in the metadata. Note that your snippet says `sync def`, but since you are calling `await`, this function should remain `async def`:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

async def process_chunk(chunk: str, chunk_number: int, url: str) -> ProcessedChunk:
    extracted = await get_title_and_summary(chunk, url)
    embedding = await get_embedding(chunk)

    # Parse out the domain (e.g. "docs.crawl4ai.com", "google.com", etc.)
    domain = urlparse(url).netloc

    metadata = {
        "source": domain,  # domain of the content
        "chunk_size": len(chunk),
        "crawled_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
        "url_path": urlparse(url).path
    }

    return ProcessedChunk(
        url=url,
        chunk_number=chunk_number,
        title=extracted.get("title", ""),
        summary=extracted.get("summary", ""),
        content=chunk,
        metadata=metadata,
        embedding=embedding
    )
```

- **Key line:** `domain = urlparse(url).netloc`, which extracts the domain (host) portion from the URL string. That value is then used in `"source": domain`.
- The rest is unchanged, just returning your `ProcessedChunk` as before.

2631	https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/lazy-loading/	1	Lazy-Loading Images with Crawl4AI	This guide explores the use of lazy loading in image crawling with Crawl4AI. Learn how to configure wait_for_images, scan_full_page, and scroll_delay to optimize your crawls for image-heavy websites.	"```
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, BrowserConfig
from crawl4ai.async_configs import CacheMode
async def main():
  config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    # Force the crawler to wait until images are fully loaded
    wait_for_images=True,
    # Option 1: If you want to automatically scroll the page to load images
    scan_full_page=True, # Tells the crawler to try scrolling the entire page
    scroll_delay=0.5,   # Delay (seconds) between scroll steps
    # Option 2: If the site uses a 'Load More' or JS triggers for images,
    # you can also specify js_code or wait_for logic here.
    cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
    verbose=True
  )
  async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=BrowserConfig(headless=True)) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(""https://www.example.com/gallery"", config=config)
    if result.success:
      images = result.media.get(""images"", [])
      print(""Images found:"", len(images))
      for i, img in enumerate(images[:5]):
        print(f""[Image {i}] URL: {img['src']}, Score: {img.get('score','N/A')}"")
    else:
      print(""Error:"", result.error_message)
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  asyncio.run(main())

```

**Explanation** :
  * **`wait_for_images=True`**The crawler tries to ensure images have finished loading before finalizing the HTML.
  * **`scan_full_page=True`**Tells the crawler to attempt scrolling from top to bottom. Each scroll step helps trigger lazy loading.
  * **`scroll_delay=0.5`**Pause half a second between each scroll step. Helps the site load images before continuing.


**When to Use** :
  * **Lazy-Loading** : If images appear only when the user scrolls into view, `scan_full_page` + `scroll_delay` helps the crawler see them. 
  * **Heavier Pages** : If a page is extremely long, be mindful that scanning the entire page can be slow. Adjust `scroll_delay` or the max scroll steps as needed.


## Combining with Other Link & Media Filters
You can still combine **lazy-load** logic with the usual **exclude_external_images** , **exclude_domains** , or link filtration:
```
config = CrawlerRunConfig(
  wait_for_images=True,
  scan_full_page=True,
  scroll_delay=0.5,
  # Filter out external images if you only want local ones
  exclude_external_images=True,
  # Exclude certain domains for links
  exclude_domains=[""spammycdn.com""],
)

```

This approach ensures you see **all** images from the main domain while ignoring external ones, and the crawler physically scrolls the entire page so that lazy-loading triggers.
## Tips & Troubleshooting
1. **Long Pages** - Setting `scan_full_page=True` on extremely long or infinite-scroll pages can be resource-intensive. - Consider using [hooks](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/lazy-loading/core/page-interaction/>) or specialized logic to load specific sections or “Load More” triggers repeatedly.
2. **Mixed Image Behavior** - Some sites load images in batches as you scroll. If you’re missing images, increase your `scroll_delay` or call multiple partial scrolls in a loop with JS code or hooks.
3. **Combining with Dynamic Wait** - If the site has a placeholder that only changes to a real image after a certain event, you might do `wait_for=""css:img.loaded""` or a custom JS `wait_for`.
4. **Caching** - If `cache_mode` is enabled, repeated crawls might skip some network fetches. If you suspect caching is missing new images, set `cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS` for fresh fetches.
With **lazy-loading** support, **wait_for_images** , and **scan_full_page** settings, you can capture the entire gallery or feed of images you expect—even if the site only loads them as the user scrolls. Combine these with the standard media filtering and domain exclusion for a complete link & media handling strategy.

2638	https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/multi-url-crawling/	3	Parallel Web Crawling with AsyncWebCrawler	This guide provides an overview of parallel web crawling using the AsyncWebCrawler library, including performance tips and best practices for concurrent crawling.	"```

**Notes** :
  * We **reuse** the same `AsyncWebCrawler` instance for all parallel tasks, launching **one** browser. 
  * Each parallel sub-task might get its own `session_id` so they don’t share cookies/localStorage (unless that’s desired). 
  * We limit concurrency to `max_concurrent=2` or 3 to avoid saturating CPU/memory.


## 4. Performance Tips
1. **Extra Browser Args** - `--disable-gpu`, `--no-sandbox` can help in Docker or restricted environments. - `--disable-dev-shm-usage` avoids using `/dev/shm` which can be small on some systems.
2. **Session Reuse** - If your site requires a login or you want to maintain local data across URLs, share the **same** `session_id`. - If you want isolation (each URL fresh), create unique sessions.
3. **Batching** - If you have **many** URLs (like thousands), you can do parallel crawling in chunks (like `max_concurrent=5`). - Use `arun_many()` for a built-in approach if you prefer, but the example above is often more flexible.
4. **Cache** - If your pages share many resources or you’re re-crawling the same domain repeatedly, consider setting `cache_mode=CacheMode.ENABLED` in `CrawlerRunConfig`. - If you need fresh data each time, keep `cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS`.
5. **Hooks** - You can set up global hooks for each crawler (like to block images) or per-run if you want. - Keep them consistent if you’re reusing sessions.
## 5. Summary
  * **One** `AsyncWebCrawler` + multiple calls to `.arun()` is far more efficient than launching a new crawler per URL. 
  * **Sequential** approach with a shared session is simple and memory-friendly for moderate sets of URLs. 
  * **Parallel** approach can speed up large crawls by concurrency, but keep concurrency balanced to avoid overhead. 
  * Close the crawler once at the end, ensuring the browser is only opened/closed once.


For even more advanced memory optimizations or dynamic concurrency patterns, see future sections on hooking or distributed crawling. The patterns above suffice for the majority of multi-URL scenarios—**giving you speed, simplicity, and minimal resource usage**. Enjoy your optimized crawling!

Below are some suggestions to make your crawled/embedded data more useful as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base. The goals are generally:

1. **Ensure consistent, high-quality text chunks**,
2. **Store enough metadata** to filter or re-assemble documents later, and
3. **Optimize for retrieval** so “agent” queries get the best matches quickly.

---

## 1. Improve Chunk Splitting

Right now, you chunk by looking for code fences (\`\`\`), double newlines, etc. This can work, but often results in very large or inconsistent chunks. For better RAG context, it’s often helpful to keep chunks around **200–300 tokens** (or \~800–1200 characters) with slight overlaps. The motivation:

- Smaller, more focused chunks return more precise search results, especially if the user’s question pertains to a small sub-section.
- Light **overlap** (e.g. 50 tokens / \~200 characters) helps avoid losing context if a chunk boundary splits a sentence or code block.

You might:

```python
def chunk_text(text: str, chunk_size: int = 800, overlap: int = 200) -> List[str]:
    ...
```

And carefully slice each chunk with a 200-char overlap so continuity is preserved.

---

## 2. Clean / Normalize the Markdown

In your sample data, some chunks contain leftover nav menus or repeated “Search” blocks. Sometimes that helps for link discovery, but for RAG it just adds noise.

**Consider**:

- Filtering out known repeated nav elements (like `[ Home ]`, `[ Quick Start ]`, “xClose Type to start searching”), so your chunks are more semantically focused.
- Removing or rewriting repeated headings like “Site built with …” or “Search.”

This makes your embeddings more accurate and less diluted with boilerplate.

---

## 3. Richer Metadata

Right now, you store `metadata` as JSON with `"source"`, `"url_path"`, `"chunk_size"`, `"crawled_at"`. That’s great for basic filtering. But for RAG usage, consider adding:

- **`domain`**: If you haven’t already replaced `"source": "docs_crawl4ai"` with the actual domain (e.g. `docs.crawl4ai.com`), do so. Then you can quickly filter by domain.
- **`doc_title` or `page_title`**: The page-level “title” from `<title>` (if you parse the HTML) or an H1 heading. That helps with quick “show me pages about X.”
- **`section_headings`**: If your doc has structural headings (H2, H3), store them. Helps an agent see the chunk’s “section context.”
- **`last_modified`**: You already parse this; store it in metadata for RAG filters like “only show me the latest version.”

By having robust metadata, you can build narrower queries, e.g. “Find only chunks from domain = docs.crawl4ai.com that were last\_modified > 2025-01-01.”

---

## 4. Parse Out Titles vs. Summaries More Precisely

Your `title` extraction is good, but you can see some chunks produce “# Some Heading” or repeated text. If you want each chunk to have a meaningful local “title,” you can:

- Extract the nearest preceding heading or subheading from the original HTML.
- Or ask the LLM to produce a short “section\_title” in a separate field from “summary.”

Then the “summary” can be more of a short 1–2 sentence description. This helps your QA agent quickly see what that chunk is about.

---

## 5. Store Embeddings in a Vector-friendly Column

If you are using Postgres, consider installing the [pgvector extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) so your `crawl4ai_chunks.embedding` can be stored in a true `vector` column. That way you can:

- **Index** the embeddings for fast similarity search (`<->`).
- Use queries like:
  ```sql
  SELECT *, embedding <-> '[1.23, 0.45, ...]' as distance
  FROM crawl4ai_chunks
  ORDER BY distance
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
  This is faster than storing embeddings as JSON or arrays and doing custom Python loops.

Alternatively, many devs push these embeddings into a specialized vector DB (like Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.). But if your data stays in Postgres, pgvector is a smooth approach.

---

## 6. Handle Duplicate Pages / Upserts

Your logs mention “duplicate key” for `page_url`. In a RAG workflow, you might recrawl the same docs regularly. So you probably want one of:

- **Upsert**: If the page already exists, update its content (e.g. `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`).
- Or **versioning**: Keep previous versions but also store a `current_version` or `version_id` so you can see changes over time.

Otherwise, you’ll keep hitting uniqueness constraint errors or risk storing old content.

---

## 7. Consider Overlap in Title/Summary

Sometimes you’ll see a chunk’s “title” is the same as the page-level title, or it might contain leftover headings. You can refine your prompt or do an advanced approach:

```text
Prompt:
"Please extract the best short heading for this chunk (3-6 words),
and a 1-sentence summary. Output valid JSON only."

{ chunk text }
```

Then parse that JSON. Or parse HTML headings directly if you want a guaranteed structure.

---

## 8. Query-Time Summaries or Pre-Summaries?

RAG can do:

- **On-the-fly summarization**: Just retrieve relevant chunks at query time, then let the LLM summarize them.
- **Pre-summarization** (which you’re already doing) for each chunk. If the docs are huge, chunk-level summaries can be useful. But keep them short so they don’t overshadow more relevant text during QA.

Try to keep chunk summaries to \~1–2 sentences. That ensures a user sees the gist but can still read the original chunk.

---

## 9. Link Chunks Back to Their Document

When your agent returns an answer, it’s often nice to show *where* the text came from. You are storing the URL in the chunk’s `url` column. That’s good. Another idea is to store a `doc_id` foreign key (like a UUID or primary key from `crawl4ai_pages`) so you can quickly join back to the full page or gather neighboring chunks.

---

## 10. Remove or Trim Redundant “Front Matter”

In the example data, many chunks start with links:

```
[Crawl4AI Documentation](...) ...
* [ Home ](...) ...
* [ Quick Start ](...) ...
```

This nav menu is repeated in **multiple** chunks, so it can hurt retrieval. You could parse out or strip these repeating nav lines with a small regex or custom HTML-based filter. That way each chunk focuses on real doc content.

---

### Putting it All Together

A typical RAG pipeline might look like:

1. **Crawl** each URL and store the raw HTML or Markdown.
2. **Preprocess** (remove nav footers, big boilerplate).
3. **Chunk** the text consistently (smallish chunks with overlap).
4. **Call LLM** to get short local title or heading + 1–2 sentence summary.
5. **Embed** each chunk with your local SentenceTransformers model.
6. **Store** everything in a DB that supports vector similarity (e.g. Postgres + pgvector).
7. **On query**:
   - Convert user question → embedding
   - Search top-K chunks (similarity)
   - Combine them → final LLM call → returns answer with sources

With the improvements above—especially cleaning out the repeated nav text, adding domain/page metadata, and using smaller, consistent chunks—you’ll see more relevant matches and easier RAG responses.

Below is an updated script that incorporates the improvements we discussed for a better RAG pipeline:

1. **Remove boilerplate** and navigation lines from the Markdown.
2. **Use smaller chunk sizes with overlap** for more fine-grained retrieval.
3. **Add page-level metadata** like a doc title (and optional headings) into each chunk’s metadata.
4. **Use an upsert** for page inserts so duplicates don’t error out.
5. **Store domain** as `"source"` in chunk metadata.
6. **Include `last_modified`** in chunk metadata, too (optional but recommended).

Feel free to tweak these regex patterns or heading-extraction methods to fit your docs more precisely.

### Explanation of Key Changes

1. **`remove_boilerplate_markdown()`** – A naive function to strip repeated nav lines, search prompts, or any known pattern from your docs. Adjust the `if ... continue` rules to remove any lines you consider “noise” or “boilerplate.”

2. **`extract_doc_title()`** – Finds the first `# Title` line in the Markdown and uses that as the doc’s “title.” If nothing is found, defaults to `"Untitled"`. This gets saved in `metadata["doc_title"]` for each chunk.

3. **Overlap-based chunking** – `chunk_text()` now uses a smaller `chunk_size=800` with an `overlap=200`. Adjust these numbers if you prefer bigger or smaller chunks.

4. **Doc-level upsert** – In `insert_crawled_page()`, we used `ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO UPDATE` to avoid errors from duplicates. That way, if a page’s content changes or you recrawl, you’ll simply update the existing record.

5. **Enriched Metadata** – Each chunk’s metadata includes:
   - `source`: domain (e.g. `"docs.crawl4ai.com"`)
   - `doc_title`: the doc-level heading from `extract_doc_title()`
   - `last_modified` (if available from the sitemap)
   - `crawled_at`, `chunk_size`, etc.

6. **Title + Summary** – We still call `llama3.2:1b` to produce a short chunk-level title and summary.

With these improvements, the data in your `crawl4ai_chunks` table should be much more RAG-friendly: smaller, more specific chunks with less boilerplate noise and better metadata for future filtering or context assembly.

Below is a point-by-point review of the **10 suggestions** from earlier, checking them against the provided Python script. Where something is missing or can be improved, I've made the corresponding code edits. In particular, **Suggestion #5** (using a vector-friendly column with pgvector) was not present; everything else looks well-covered.

---

## 1. **Use Smaller Chunk Sizes with Overlap**

> **Suggestion**: “Use smaller chunk sizes (\~200–300 tokens) with some overlap to avoid losing context.”

**Implementation**\
In the updated script, `chunk_text()` takes `chunk_size=800` and `overlap=200`. That **does** create smaller chunks with overlap. Feel free to adjust to a specific token count, but the general idea is there.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 2. **Clean / Normalize the Markdown**

> **Suggestion**: “Strip out repeated nav lines, footers, or other boilerplate.”

**Implementation**\
There’s now a `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` function that filters out lines matching certain patterns (e.g. lines that contain `[ Home ]`, or “Type to start searching”). You can expand that logic or refine the regex checks, but it’s in place.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 3. **Store Richer Metadata**

> **Suggestion**: “Include domain, doc title, chunk size, last\_modified, etc. in metadata.”

**Implementation**\
The script sets:

```python
metadata = {
  "source": domain,
  "doc_title": doc_title,
  "chunk_size": len(chunk),
  "crawled_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
  "url_path": urlparse(url).path
}
if last_modified:
  metadata["last_modified"] = last_modified
```

So domain, doc\_title, last\_modified, etc. are included.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 4. **Parse Out a Doc Title from the Page**

> **Suggestion**: “Use a doc-level heading or HTML `<title>` for a page-level title in each chunk’s metadata.”

**Implementation**\
The script has an `extract_doc_title()` function, which finds the first `# ...` heading in the cleaned Markdown. It stores that in `doc_title`, which is then placed in the chunk’s `metadata`.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 5. **Store Embeddings in a Vector-Friendly Column**

> **Suggestion**: “Use pgvector or a dedicated vector DB, rather than JSON or text, for better similarity search performance.”

**Current Script**\
Right now, the script **still** stores `embedding` as `json.dumps(chunk.embedding)` in the `crawl4ai_chunks` table. That works, but it **doesn’t** implement the pgvector approach. If you want to fully adopt suggestion #5, you must:

1. Install the [pgvector extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) in Postgres:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```

2. Alter your table definition, for example:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE crawl4ai_chunks
   DROP COLUMN embedding,
   ADD COLUMN embedding vector(384);
   ```
   (assuming 384 is your embedding dimension).

3. In Python, **insert** the raw float list into that vector column, for example:
   ```python
   await conn.execute(
       """
       INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
         (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content, metadata, embedding)
       VALUES
         ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7::vector)
       """,
       chunk.url,
       chunk.chunk_number,
       chunk.title,
       chunk.summary,
       chunk.content,
       json.dumps(chunk.metadata),
       chunk.embedding  # pass the python list of floats
   )
   ```
   Then you can query with vector ops (e.g., `<->` for distance).

**Proposed Improvement**\
Below is a **modified** version of `insert_chunk()` that uses **pgvector**. If you have not installed pgvector, you’ll need to do so and update your table schema accordingly.

```python
async def insert_chunk(chunk: ProcessedChunk):
    if not pool:
        raise RuntimeError("DB connection pool is not initialized.")
    try:
        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
                  (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content, metadata, embedding)
                VALUES
                  ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7::vector)
                """,
                chunk.url,
                chunk.chunk_number,
                chunk.title,
                chunk.summary,
                chunk.content,
                json.dumps(chunk.metadata),
                chunk.embedding  # pass the float[] directly
            )
        print(f"Inserted chunk {chunk.chunk_number} for {chunk.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error inserting chunk: {e}")
```

**Conclusion**\
**Not** implemented by default (the script still uses JSON), but easy to fix. Just adopt the steps above, and you’ll have suggestion #5 fully covered.

---

## 6. **Handle Duplicate Pages with Upserts**

> **Suggestion**: “If a page is recrawled, avoid primary key collisions—update or skip.”

**Implementation**\
`insert_crawled_page()` does:

```sql
ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO UPDATE
  SET raw_markdown  = EXCLUDED.raw_markdown,
      created_at    = EXCLUDED.created_at,
      last_modified = EXCLUDED.last_modified
```

That means the page record is upserted. Perfect for duplicates. (Note that we’re not doing an upsert for chunks, but that’s typically less critical unless your chunking changes on recrawls.)

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 7. **Use Overlap in Title/Summary?** (Short Summaries)

> **Suggestion**: “Keep chunk-level summaries short, \~1–2 sentences.”

**Implementation**\
The prompt to the LLM says: “Extract a short 'title' and a 'summary' ...” That’s *likely* to yield short text. You can be more explicit (“1–2 sentences maximum”), but it’s basically done.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 8. **Query-Time Summaries vs. Pre-summaries**

> **Suggestion**: “You can store chunk summaries or generate them on the fly. Keeping them short is recommended.”

**Implementation**\
This script does pre-summarize each chunk, which is fine for smaller sets of docs or for quickly browsing chunk overviews. The summary is presumably short. If you find it’s too long or too varied, just add “Limit your summary to 2 sentences.” in the prompt. That detail is minor.

✅ **Satisfied** (already in code to some extent).

---

## 9. **Link Chunks Back to Their Document**

> **Suggestion**: “When returning answers, show the user from which doc or chunk we got that text.”

**Implementation**\
Each chunk has a `"url"` field plus `"metadata" : {"doc_title": "...", "source": "...", etc.}`. This is enough to identify the original doc. Perfect for re-constructing references.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## 10. **Remove or Trim Repeated Front Matter**

> **Suggestion**: “Filter out repeated lines, nav menus, disclaimers, etc.”

**Implementation**\
The `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` function does exactly that, skipping lines matching known patterns (`[ Home ]`, “Type to start searching”, etc.). You can expand the logic further, but the basic approach is there.

✅ **Satisfied**.

---

## Summary of What’s Missing or Could Be Improved

Everything except suggestion #5 (the **pgvector** approach) has been implemented. Right now the script stores embeddings as JSON. If you want real vector search in Postgres, you must:

1. Install pgvector.
2. Change the `embedding` column to a `vector(...)` type.
3. Insert using `$7::vector` or `$7::float8[]` so that your list of floats is recognized as a vector.

Below is a final snippet for `insert_chunk()` reflecting that change (if you want to incorporate it). Other than that, the script effectively covers **all 10** suggestions.

---

### Final `insert_chunk()` if Using pgvector

```python
async def insert_chunk(chunk: ProcessedChunk):
    if not pool:
        raise RuntimeError("DB connection pool is not initialized.")
    try:
        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
                (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content, metadata, embedding)
                VALUES
                ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7::vector)
                """,
                chunk.url,
                chunk.chunk_number,
                chunk.title,
                chunk.summary,
                chunk.content,
                json.dumps(chunk.metadata),
                chunk.embedding  # a Python float[] 
            )
        print(f"Inserted chunk {chunk.chunk_number} for {chunk.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error inserting chunk: {e}")
```

*(Requires your `crawl4ai_chunks.embedding` column be `vector(384)` (or the correct dimension) and `CREATE EXTENSION vector` installed.)*

With that, all 10 suggestions are fully addressed.

Overall, the script looks **very close** to what you need. However, there's one clear mismatch in the **`insert_crawled_page()`** function:

```python
async def insert_crawled_page(page_url: str, raw_markdown: str, last_modified: Optional[str]):
  ...
  await conn.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
      (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content, metadata, embedding)
    VALUES
      ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7::vector)
    """,
    ...
  )
```

**Problem**

- That snippet references the **`crawl4ai_chunks`** table (not `crawl4ai_pages`), and it tries to insert columns like `chunk_number`, `embedding`, etc. But your original intention for `insert_crawled_page()` was to upsert a record in **`crawl4ai_pages`** containing just `page_url`, `raw_markdown`, `last_modified`, etc.

**Correct Approach**

- `insert_crawled_page()` should do an **upsert** into **`crawl4ai_pages`**, not `crawl4ai_chunks`.
- It shouldn’t reference embedding or chunk columns.

Below is the **fixed** version of `insert_crawled_page()` that actually inserts/upserts into the `crawl4ai_pages` table. Additionally, note you need to do `async with pool.acquire() as conn:` to get a database connection:

```python
async def insert_crawled_page(page_url: str, raw_markdown: str, last_modified: Optional[str]):
    """
    Use an upsert so if page_url already exists, we update its raw_markdown.
    This avoids duplicate key violations.
    """
    try:
        if last_modified:
            dt = dateutil.parser.parse(last_modified)
            dt_utc = dt.astimezone(timezone.utc)
            last_modified_dt = dt_utc.replace(tzinfo=None)
        else:
            last_modified_dt = None

        created_at_dt = datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None)

        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO crawl4ai_pages(page_url, raw_markdown, created_at, last_modified)
                VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
                ON CONFLICT (page_url) DO UPDATE
                  SET raw_markdown  = EXCLUDED.raw_markdown,
                      created_at    = EXCLUDED.created_at,
                      last_modified = EXCLUDED.last_modified
                """,
                page_url,
                raw_markdown,
                created_at_dt,
                last_modified_dt
            )

        print(f"Upserted raw markdown to crawl4ai_pages for {page_url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error inserting/updating raw markdown page: {e}")
```

With this fix, your code will:

1. **Upsert** the page record in `crawl4ai_pages`
2. **Insert** chunk records in `crawl4ai_chunks` (with embeddings in the `vector` column)

And everything else in your script looks good.

---

### Summary

- **Yes**, your script is now properly using a `vector` column for embeddings in **`crawl4ai_chunks`**.
- **Yes**, the chunk logic, prompt calls, overlap chunking, and boilerplate removal all look solid.
- **Just** make sure `insert_crawled_page()` references **`crawl4ai_pages`** with the correct columns.

After that small fix, you should be all set. Enjoy your new RAG-friendly database!

That error occurs because **asyncpg** can’t automatically cast a Python `list[float]` to the Postgres `vector` type. You must **manually** convert the embedding list into a **string** in `pgvector` format (e.g. `"[0.123, 0.456]"`).

Below is the change you need in `insert_chunk()`. The key is creating a string like `"[1.234, 2.345, 3.456]"` for `$7`, then using `::$vector` in the SQL so Postgres parses it correctly.

---

## 1) Convert Python list → pgvector string

For instance:

```python
def to_pgvector_str(embedding: List[float]) -> str:
    # Convert [1.234, 2.345] → "[1.234, 2.345]"
    # Commas or spaces are both valid in pgvector syntax.
    # We’ll do commas for clarity.
    return "[" + ", ".join(f"{val}" for val in embedding) + "]"
```

## 2) Use that function when inserting

In your `insert_chunk()`:

```python
async def insert_chunk(chunk: ProcessedChunk):
    if not pool:
        raise RuntimeError("DB connection pool is not initialized.")
    try:
        embedding_str = to_pgvector_str(chunk.embedding)  # produce "[0.123, 0.456]" etc.

        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
                  (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content, metadata, embedding)
                VALUES
                  ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7::vector)
                """,
                chunk.url,
                chunk.chunk_number,
                chunk.title,
                chunk.summary,
                chunk.content,
                json.dumps(chunk.metadata),
                embedding_str  # pass the string, not the list
            )
        print(f"Inserted chunk {chunk.chunk_number} for {chunk.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error inserting chunk: {e}")
```

That will prevent the **“expected str, got list”** error. The param `$7` is now just a string in the bracketed format that `pgvector` recognizes (e.g. `"[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]"`). Postgres then applies `::vector` to parse it as a vector.

---

### Why This Happens

- **asyncpg** sees a Python `list[float]` and tries to treat it like a JSON or array, which doesn’t match the custom `::vector` type.
- By giving it a bracketed string (`"[0.1, 0.2]"`), we rely on `pgvector` to parse that string into a vector.

With that fix, your embeddings will be properly stored in the new `vector` column without the “invalid input for query argument” error.

## Schedule Recurring Jobs with Cron Syntax in Postgres
Supabase Cron is a Postgres Module that simplifies scheduling recurring Jobs with cron syntax and monitoring Job runs inside Postgres.
Cron Jobs can be created via SQL or the Cron interface inside of Supabase Dashboard and can run anywhere from every second to once a year depending on your use case.

Overall, the outputs look **pretty good**: you have smaller chunks, embeddings in the `vector` column, meaningful doc titles, etc. However, from those sample rows, there are **a few leftover bits** in the text that you might want to trim out for a cleaner final dataset. Here are some ideas:

---

## 1. Strip More Image References & Base64-Like Strings

You can see lines like:

```
kKgEEbNiPY7LE)![Supabase wordmark](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url...
```

and

```
[![Supabase wordmark](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fsupabase-dark.svg...
```

Those appear to be partial markup or leftover from images. If you don’t want them in your text, expand your **boilerplate removal** logic to skip or remove lines containing:

- `"![Supabase wordmark]"`
- Lines that have `"/_next/image?url"`
- Possibly any mention of `svg&w=256&q=75` or `kKgEEbNiPY7LE`, etc.

For example, in `remove_boilerplate_markdown()`, you could add:

```python
if "![supabase wordmark]" in line_stripped:
    continue
if "/_next/image?url" in line_stripped:
    continue
```

(Adjust as you see patterns.)

---

## 2. Skip “Search docs…”, “Main menu”, “K”, etc.

You do skip `"type to start searching"` lines, but your sample chunk shows strings like:

```
Search docs...
K
Main menu
```

If they’re not meaningful,Overall, the outputs look **pretty good**: you have smaller chunks, embeddings in the `vector` column, meaningful doc titles, etc. However, from those sample rows, there are **a few leftover bits** in the text that you might want to trim out for a cleaner final dataset. Here are some ideas:

---

- `"![Supabase wordmark]"`

if "kKgEEbNiPY7LE" in line_stripped:
    continue
```

(Adjust as you see patterns.)

---

## 2. Skip “Search docs…”, “Main menu”, “K”, etc.

You do skip `"type to start searching"` lines, but your sample chunk shows strings like:

```
Search docs...
K
Main menu
```

If they’re not meaningful, you can remove them exactly the same way (checking that snippet in `line_stripped`). For example:

```python
if "search docs..." in line_stripped:
    continue
if line_stripped == "main menu":
    continue
if line_stripped == "k":
    continue
```

---

## 3. Remove or Shorten Partial Links Like `</docs>`

You might also see leftover partial references, e.g. `</docs/guides/cron>` or `</docs>` at the end of a URL. If it’s just useless link fluff, you can strip them with a small regex or a direct check:

```python
line = re.sub(r"</docs[^>]*>", "", line, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

(This can remove `</docs>` or `</docs/guides/blah>` from anywhere in the line.)

---

## 4. Extra HTML or Markup?

If you see other leftover HTML tags (`<img>`, `<header>`, etc.), you could parse them out or just skip lines that contain them. Right now, your text has:

```
DOCS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/</docs>)
```

Which is a partial leftover bracket. Similarly, you might run a quick naive “HTML pass” with `re.sub(r"<[^>]*>", "", line)` to remove any HTML tags.

---

## 5. Confirm You Want That “Doc Title” in the First Chunk

If you see lines repeated in multiple chunks (like the doc’s heading in multiple chunks), you may be okay with it or you might want to further refine how you chunk. For instance, you might skip the first \~1–2 lines if they’re just a repeated heading. This is subjective—some folks keep the heading, some drop it from the chunk text.

---

## 6. Consider Stricter Sentence Splitting

If you want even more precise chunks, you could split on **sentences** or paragraphs rather than raw character-based overlap. Then you’d rejoin them in 2–3 sentence chunks with overlap. This can yield more semantically clean fragments. That’s a bigger change, but can be helpful if your text is very sentence-structured.

---

## 7. Upsert the `crawl4ai_pages` Table Properly

Make sure your `insert_crawled_page()` function is upserting into the **`crawl4ai_pages`** table (with columns like `page_url, raw_markdown, ...`), while your chunk insertion is in **`crawl4ai_chunks`** (with `embedding`, `title`, etc.). This might already be fixed, but definitely confirm you’re not mixing them up.

---

## Conclusion

These leftover artifacts don’t *break* anything, but they can clutter search and confuse an LLM. If you prefer the raw data, it’s fine—but typically for a RAG pipeline, you get better results by removing extraneous placeholders, partial bracket lines, and embedded image references. So the main improvement would be **expanding your `remove_boilerplate_markdown()`** function to skip or scrub any lines containing these weird fragments or leftover link markup. Once you do that, your final stored chunks will be even more readable and relevant.

Below is an updated script with **expanded boilerplate removal** to handle:

- **Image references** (`"![Supabase wordmark]"`, `"/_next/image?url"`, `"kKgEEbNiPY7LE"`)
- **Extra nav lines** (`"search docs..."`, `"main menu"`, or a line equal to `"k"`)
- **Partial link references** (removes `"</docs...>"` strings)
- **Leftover HTML tags** (simple regex to remove `"<...>"`)

We **haven’t** changed how chunking works; it’s still character-based with overlaps. Everything else is the same as your current script.

### Key Changes

1. **`remove_boilerplate_markdown()`**:
   - Removes leftover `</docs...>` substrings and `<...>` tags.
   - Skips lines with `![Supabase wordmark]`, `/_next/image?url`, `kKgEEbNiPY7LE` or `search docs...`, etc.
   - You can keep adding more conditions for any additional junk lines you see.

2. **`to_pgvector_str()`** helper\*\*:\*\*
   - Converts the Python list of floats to bracketed string format so Postgres can parse it as a vector.

With these changes, your crawled text should be a bit cleaner in the final `crawl4ai_chunks`. You can always refine the skip patterns if you notice more leftover lines you want to remove.

From these new sample chunks, **most** of the text looks clean and relevant. However, there are still a few leftover bits that might be more “boilerplate” (or leftover partial references) than real content, for example:

- **GitHub Icon lines** like `"[![...](https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/github-icon-light.svg)..."`.
- The repeated text like `[© Supabase Inc](...)—[Contributing](...) [Author Styleguide](...) [SupaSquad](...)`.
- Image references for platform logos: `"(https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/kotlin-icon.svg)"`, `"(https://supabase.com/docs/img/icons/swift-icon.svg)"`, `"github-icon-light.svg"`, etc.

If you want to remove them (as you did with `![Supabase wordmark]`), simply **expand** the checks in `remove_boilerplate_markdown()`:

1. **Skip lines** with references to `"github-icon-light.svg"`, `"icons/kotlin-icon.svg"`, `"icons/swift-icon.svg"`, `"icons/svelte-icon.svg"`, etc.
2. Possibly strip or skip `[© Supabase Inc]`, `[Contributing]`, `[Open Source]`, `[SupaSquad]`, if you consider them boilerplate repeated on many pages.
3. If you see partial leftover references like `Use Supabase as a Retrieval Store for your ChatGPT plugin`, or `(...)privacy settings(...)`, you can decide if it’s relevant or not. If it’s repeated on every doc page, maybe skip it.

Concretely, you could do something like:

```python
line_stripped = line_stripped.replace("github-icon-light.svg", "")
line_stripped = line_stripped.replace("icons/kotlin-icon.svg", "")
line_stripped = line_stripped.replace("icons/swift-icon.svg", "")
line_stripped = line_stripped.replace("icons/svelte-icon.svg", "")
...
if "© supabase inc" in line_stripped:
    continue
if "privacy settings" in line_stripped:
    continue
if "supasquad" in line_stripped:
    continue
if line_stripped.startswith("[contributing]"):
    continue
...
```

Obviously, fine-tune those conditions to match your actual data. If you see leftover lines with `## Integrations[#](...)` or `(#)(https://...)`, you can skip or remove them with extra logic.

---

### TL;DR

- **Yes**, your script is working great overall.
- You can keep refining `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` if you still see repeated icon references, leftover link fragments, or other lines that add little semantic value.
- Everything else—overlap chunking, LLM title/summary, embedding to pgvector—already looks good!

Eventually you’ll land on exactly how much you want to keep. The partial references you see in the samples are mostly from repeated doc nav, so adjusting your skip filters further can yield even cleaner text for RAG.

let's tackle sentence splitting

Below is an example of **sentence-based chunking** in place of your previous character-based approach. We'll use **NLTK** for sentence tokenization, grouping sentences into chunks up to a target size (in characters). We still allow an *overlap* parameter—meaning we’ll repeat the last $n$ sentences of each chunk at the start of the next chunk—so you don’t lose context between chunks.

**Important**: Make sure you install and download NLTK data (e.g., `pip install nltk` then in Python `import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')`) before running this script.

### Explanation

1. **NLTK Sentence Splitting**
   - We import `sent_tokenize` from `nltk` to break text into sentences.
   - We gather sentences until we exceed `target_size` (approx. 800 chars). Then we flush that chunk and optionally carry over the last `sentence_overlap` sentences into the next chunk.

2. **`chunk_text_by_sentence()`**
   - Replaces the older `chunk_text()` that used raw character slicing.
   - By default, `target_size=800` chars and `sentence_overlap=2` sentences. Adjust as desired.

3. **Remainder** of the script
   - The rest remains the same: removing boilerplate, extracting doc-level titles, calling LLM for chunk summaries, embedding them, and inserting them into Postgres with a `vector` column.

4. **Note** that sentence-based chunking (especially with overlap) tends to create more “semantically clean” chunks, but at times you might get smaller or bigger chunks depending on the variety of sentence lengths.

With this approach, you’ll get more “natural” text boundaries for your RAG pipeline, typically improving retrieval because each chunk lines up with real sentence-level context.

That **Page.content: Target page, context or browser has been closed** error typically comes up when Playwright’s underlying browser closes (or crashes) before the crawler finishes. A few common reasons and fixes:

---

## 1. Lower the Concurrency

If you’re crawling 2,000+ URLs in parallel, the browser may consume too much memory or CPU and close itself. Reducing the `max_concurrent` value can help:

```python
await crawl_parallel(urls_with_lastmod, max_concurrent=2)
```

Try smaller concurrency (like 2–3) and see if the error goes away.

---

## 2. Increase Timeouts or Add Retries

If certain pages take a long time or if your environment is resource-limited, you can:

- Increase `browser_config` timeouts or `crawl_config` timeouts.
- Add **retry** logic around `crawler.arun(url=...)` so a single crash or slow page doesn’t permanently fail the entire doc.

For example:

```python
async def process_url(url: str, last_modified: Optional[str]):
    for attempt in range(2):  # up to 2 tries
        try:
            result = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=crawl_config, session_id="session_docs_crawl4ai")
            if result.success:
                ...
                return
            else:
                print(f"Failed: {url} - Error: {result.error_message}")
                return
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Exception on {url} - retry {attempt+1}. {e}")
    print(f"Gave up on {url} after 2 attempts.")
```

---

## 3. Break the Crawl into Batches

Instead of sending all \~2k URLs at once, you can chunk them into smaller groups of e.g. 200 URLs, do a fresh `AsyncWebCrawler.start() / .close()` each batch. That ensures you don’t keep the same browser context open for thousands of pages continuously. For instance:

```python
batch_size = 200
batches = [urls_with_lastmod[i:i+batch_size] for i in range(0, len(urls_with_lastmod), batch_size)]

for idx, batch in enumerate(batches):
    print(f"Processing batch {idx+1} with {len(batch)} URLs...")
    await crawl_parallel(batch, max_concurrent=3)
```

This can reduce memory usage and handle extremely large sitemaps more gracefully.

---

## 4. Resource Constraints / Puppeteer Crashes

If your server (or Docker environment) is memory-limited, large crawls can cause the browser to crash. Possible solutions:

- Increase swap or memory resources on the machine.
- Use `headless=False` or different `BrowserConfig` options to reduce overhead.
- Make sure the system has plenty of CPU & memory for Playwright plus the rest of your pipeline.

---

## 5. Add Some Delays Between Crawls

If all else fails, you can slow down the overall process. For instance, insert a small `await asyncio.sleep(1)` after each URL to reduce load on the browser. This is less ideal if you want speed, but sometimes helps with fragile environments.

---

### In Short

The error means the Playwright browser context or page was closed prematurely. Usually it’s from memory exhaustion or concurrency overload. **Reducing concurrency, adding retries, or splitting into smaller batches** tends to solve it. If you still see random closures, check system logs for OOM kills or forcibly re-launch the crawler between batches of URLs.

Below is a **cleaned-up** version of your `crawl_parallel()` function that:

1. **Limits concurrency** using a semaphore.
2. **Retries** each URL up to 2 times.
3. Avoids calling `crawler.arun()` **twice** in a row for the same attempt.
4. Properly manages success/failure and logs accordingly.

```python
async def crawl_parallel(urls_with_lastmod: List[Tuple[str, Optional[str]]], max_concurrent: int = 5):
    browser_config = BrowserConfig(
        headless=True,
        verbose=False,
        extra_args=["--disable-gpu", "--disable-dev-shm-usage", "--no-sandbox"],
    )
    crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS)

    crawler = AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config)
    await crawler.start()

    try:
        # Use a Semaphore to limit concurrency
        semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)

        async def process_url(url: str, last_modified: Optional[str]):
            # We'll retry each URL up to 2 times if something goes wrong
            for attempt in range(2):
                try:
                    # Acquire the semaphore so we only crawl max_concurrent at once
                    async with semaphore:
                        result = await crawler.arun(
                            url=url,
                            config=crawl_config,
                            session_id="session_docs_crawl4ai"
                        )

                    if result.success:
                        print(f"Successfully crawled (attempt {attempt+1}): {url}")
                        await insert_crawled_page(
                            page_url=url,
                            raw_markdown=result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown,
                            last_modified=last_modified
                        )
                        # Process & store doc (chunks, embeddings, etc.)
                        await process_and_store_document(url, result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown, last_modified)
                        return  # Done, no need to retry further
                    else:
                        print(f"Failed (attempt {attempt+1}) for {url} - Error: {result.error_message}")

                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Exception on attempt {attempt+1} for {url}: {e}")

            # If we get here, it means 2 attempts failed
            print(f"Gave up on {url} after 2 attempts.")

        # Create tasks for all URLs
        tasks = [process_url(u, lm) for (u, lm) in urls_with_lastmod]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    finally:
        await crawler.close()
```

### Explanation

- **Semaphore**: We wrap each `crawler.arun(...)` call in `async with semaphore` so that no more than `max_concurrent` calls happen at the same time.
- **Retries**: If `result.success` is `False` **or** an exception is thrown, we just loop again (up to 2 tries).
- If it **does** succeed, we do the DB inserts, then `return` (no further attempts).
- If we exhaust all attempts, we log “Gave up on {url}...”

This approach ensures:

- You don’t re-call `crawler.arun()` in the same success branch.
- Concurrency is properly limited.
- You handle partial failures gracefully.

**Short answer**: You need to download the `punkt_tab` resource. Run the following in a Python shell or notebook:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

That will fetch the required tokenizer data so NLTK can do sentence splitting.

---

## Why This Happens

By default, many NLTK sentence tokenizers just require `'punkt'`. Here, the error explicitly asks for `'punkt_tab'`. This can happen if:

- You’re using a particular variant of the tokenizer that references the `'punkt_tab'` data.
- Or you’re on an NLTK version that unexpectedly tries to load `'punkt_tab'`.

In any case, just installing `'punkt_tab'` is the easiest solution.

---

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Enter your Conda environment** (the same one you run the crawler in), e.g.:
   ```bash
   conda activate crawl4ai
   ```
2. \*\*Start Python

It looks like NLTK is attempting to load a subresource named **`punkt_tab`**, which isn’t part of the standard `punkt` tokenizer. Some versions or configurations of NLTK expect that file.

Here are **two approaches** to fix it:

---

## 1) Download `punkt_tab` Directly

**In your same Conda environment** (`conda activate crawl4ai`), open a Python shell and run:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

If `punkt_tab` is available, this will download it and place it in your `nltk_data` folder. That should resolve the error.

---

## 2) Download “All” or Manually Install Data

If for some reason `punkt_tab` isn’t recognized, you can tell NLTK to download **all** tokenizers and resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
```

This is heavier (downloads everything), but guaranteed to include the `punkt` resources. Once done, re-run your crawler to confirm the error is gone.

---

## 3) Verify Your Environment & Paths

Sometimes you download NLTK data in a different Python environment or user directory. Make sure you run these downloads **inside** the same Conda environment that runs your crawler. For example:

1. `conda activate crawl4ai`
2. `python`
3. ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt_tab')
   ```
4. Confirm that it downloads successfully and that the path it installs to matches one of the paths in the error message (`/home/ashwin/nltk_data` or `/home/ashwin/miniconda3/envs/crawl4ai/nltk_data`, etc.).

Once installed, `punkt_tab` references should no longer fail. If the error persists, check the NLTK data paths:

```python
import nltk
print(nltk.data.path)
```

Ensure your newly downloaded data directory is on that list. If not, you can add it:

```python
import nltk
nltk.data.path.append('/path/to/your/custom/nltk_data')
```

But generally, **just installing `punkt_tab`** (or `all`) in the correct environment is enough.

It looks like downloading `nltk.download('all')` resolved the error about `punkt_tab`, and your crawler is now successfully crawling and inserting pages without further issues.

**If you see** similar resource errors in the future, you can run `nltk.download('XYZ')` for whichever missing resource is mentioned. Since you downloaded `all`, you should now have the entire NLTK dataset and probably won’t need to do that again.

**Summarized**:

- You installed the complete NLTK data (including `punkt_tab`), which fixed the error.
- The crawler now processes and stores the chunks as intended.

Yes, what you’re seeing does look like **sentence-based** chunks. Notice that:

- The text is split roughly every few sentences (up to \~800 characters).
- Each chunk is typically one to a few sentences (instead of arbitrary character slices).
- Some small leftover references or markup are still there, but each chunk is more “natural” sentence boundaries.

As long as you see chunks that correspond to 1–3 (or so) sentences, that’s the outcome of the `sent_tokenize()` approach with a target character size. If you’re comfortable with how big each chunk is and how the overlap (two sentences) appears at the boundary, then this is the expected result.

---

### Why Some Chunks Contain Extra Markup

Certain lines still have `[...](...)` references. This is normal if those lines come from the original Markdown and you haven’t stripped them in your `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` function. If you want them removed, you could expand your cleanup logic. Otherwise, it’s safe to keep them, as each chunk is still formed on real sentence boundaries.

---

### Verifying Overlap

If you look closely, you might notice the **last 2 sentences** of one chunk repeated at the start of the next. That’s by design (`sentence_overlap=2`), ensuring queries that cross chunk boundaries still have context. If you want less repetition, you can reduce `sentence_overlap` to 1 or 0, or set it higher if you need more continuity between chunks.

In short, these **are** the expected outputs for a sentence-splitting approach with a \~800 character target size and an overlap of 2 sentences. You’ll generally see clearer, more semantically complete segments than raw character-based chunking.

what is the advantage of storing the metadata as json rather than an indexed column in the database?

Storing metadata as JSON (as opposed to splitting every field into its own indexed column) offers a **flexibility vs. structure** trade-off. The main advantages are:

1. **Schema flexibility:**
   - You can add or remove metadata fields without altering the database schema.
   - If your crawler starts capturing a new field tomorrow (say, `"section_heading"` or `"language_code"`), you don’t have to `ALTER TABLE` to accommodate it.
   - This is especially helpful if the metadata can vary by document type or source.

2. **Ease of ingestion:**
   - You can take the entire metadata dictionary and store it directly as JSON without mapping each key to a dedicated column.
   - Fewer places to update if you routinely change the shape of the metadata.

3. **Optional JSON queries:**
   - If you’re on Postgres, you can still do JSON-path queries (`->>`, `->`, `@>`, etc.) on a JSONB column if needed.
   - You can even create GIN indexes on that JSON field for certain keys, if you want to optimize lookups on e.g. `"doc_title"` or `"source"`.

However, the **downside** is:

- You lose some of the **strong typing** and clarity you get from dedicated columns.
- If you do frequent equality or range queries on `"crawled_at"`, for instance, you might want it as a real `TIMESTAMP` column so that indexes and queries are simpler and more performant.
- If certain metadata fields are critical to your queries or filters, it can be better to have them in their own columns (and possibly indexed).

In short: **JSON is more flexible and simpler to store dynamic metadata**. If you need *highly-structured, heavily-filtered* fields with frequent queries, you may prefer separate indexed columns. Many teams do a hybrid approach (core fields in columns, rarely used or variable fields in JSON) for the best of both worlds.

all of these seem like standard values that we want to index for all documents. convert these to indexed values

Below is an example of **converting** your previously JSON-based metadata fields (`source`, `url_path`, `doc_title`, `chunk_size`, `crawled_at`) into **indexed columns** in your `crawl4ai_chunks` table. This requires:

1. **Altering** your table schema (adding columns);
2. **Adjusting** your `insert_chunk()` code to store those columns directly rather than JSON; and
3. (Optionally) **creating indexes** on those columns for fast lookups.

---

## 1) Alter the Table to Add New Columns

In Postgres, you might do something like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crawl4ai_chunks
  ADD COLUMN source       text,
  ADD COLUMN url_path     text,
  ADD COLUMN doc_title    text,
  ADD COLUMN chunk_size   integer,
  ADD COLUMN crawled_at   timestamptz;
```

If you have **existing** records in `crawl4ai_chunks`, they will have NULL in these new columns unless you backfill them. If you want the columns to be **NOT NULL**, you either need a default or backfill first.

---

## 2) (Optionally) Create Indexes

For performance in filtering/queries, create indexes on whichever columns you want to do lookups on:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source    ON crawl4ai_chunks(source);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_doc_title ON crawl4ai_chunks(doc_title);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled   ON crawl4ai_chunks(crawled_at);
```

You can decide which fields you actually query or filter on frequently.

---

## 3) Update the Python `insert_chunk()` Function

Here is a **modified** snippet that references the new columns instead of storing everything in `metadata` JSON. We’ve removed the JSON `metadata` column usage (or you can still keep it if you also want leftover metadata). This version takes the 5 standard fields from `chunk.metadata[...]` and inserts them directly.

```python
async def insert_chunk(chunk: ProcessedChunk):
    if not pool:
        raise RuntimeError("DB connection pool is not initialized.")

    try:
        # Convert the embedding list to a pgvector string
        embedding_str = to_pgvector_str(chunk.embedding)

        # Pull out standard fields from chunk.metadata
        source_val     = chunk.metadata.get("source", None)
        url_path_val   = chunk.metadata.get("url_path", None)
        doc_title_val  = chunk.metadata.get("doc_title", None)
        chunk_size_val = chunk.metadata.get("chunk_size", 0)
        crawled_at_val = chunk.metadata.get("crawled_at", None)

        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
                  (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content,
                   source, url_path, doc_title, chunk_size, crawled_at,
                   embedding)
                VALUES
                  ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5,
                   $6, $7, $8, $9, $10,
                   $11::vector)
                """,
                # Existing fields
                chunk.url,
                chunk.chunk_number,
                chunk.title,
                chunk.summary,
                chunk.content,

                # New "indexed" columns
                source_val,
                url_path_val,
                doc_title_val,
                int(chunk_size_val),       # ensure int
                crawled_at_val,           # (as a string or a datetime converted to str)

                # Vector embedding
                embedding_str
            )

        print(f"Inserted chunk {chunk.chunk_number} for {chunk.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error inserting chunk: {e}")
```

**Key points**:

- We simply pass those 5 fields (`source`, `url_path`, `doc_title`, `chunk_size`, `crawled_at`) as separate columns in the `INSERT` statement.
- The JSON column `metadata` is no longer needed, or you can keep it for leftover or optional fields.
- If you want to parse `crawled_at_val` into a real Postgres timestamp, ensure it’s a valid ISO8601 or pass a Python `datetime` object (depending on your library usage).

---

### 4) Removing or Keeping the Old Metadata Column

- **Remove** if you no longer need a JSON fallback. Then you’d do `ALTER TABLE crawl4ai_chunks DROP COLUMN metadata;`.
- **Keep** if you want to store additional dynamic fields that you might not query as frequently.

---

### 5) Done!

Now your “standard” fields (like domain `source`, `chunk_size`, `doc_title`, etc.) are first-class columns, which you can index and query quickly. The main difference is **you must also ensure** the code populates them (as we did above), rather than just stuffing them into a JSON dictionary.

That error appears because **asyncpg** expects a Python `datetime` object for a Postgres `timestamptz` column, but your code is passing in a **string** (`'2025-01-22T22:18:52.611546+00:00'`). You can fix this in **one** of two ways:

---

## 1) Parse the ISO8601 string into a Python `datetime` object

Convert your `'2025-01-22T22:18:52.611546+00:00'` string to a real `datetime` before passing to asyncpg. For example, using `dateutil.parser.isoparse()`:

```python
import dateutil.parser

# ...
crawled_at_str = chunk.metadata.get("crawled_at", None)
if crawled_at_str is not None:
    # parse it into a datetime
    crawled_at_dt = dateutil.parser.isoparse(crawled_at_str)
else:
    crawled_at_dt = None
```

Then in your `INSERT` statement:

```python
await conn.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
      (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content,
       source, url_path, doc_title, chunk_size, crawled_at,
       embedding)
    VALUES
      ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5,
       $6, $7, $8, $9, $10,
       $11::vector)
    """,
    chunk.url,
    chunk.chunk_number,
    chunk.title,
    chunk.summary,
    chunk.content,
    source_val,
    url_path_val,
    doc_title_val,
    int(chunk_size_val),
    crawled_at_dt,            # pass a real datetime, not a string
    embedding_str
)
```

This way, asyncpg recognizes `crawled_at_dt` is a Python datetime and stores it properly in the `timestamptz` column.

---

## 2) Keep the string and cast in SQL

Alternatively, you can keep your ISO8601 string but **cast** it to `timestamptz` in the INSERT statement. For instance:

```python
await conn.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
      (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content,
       source, url_path, doc_title, chunk_size, crawled_at,
       embedding)
    VALUES
      ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5,
       $6, $7, $8, $9, $10::timestamptz,
       $11::vector)
    """,
    chunk.url,
    chunk.chunk_number,
    chunk.title,
    chunk.summary,
    chunk.content,
    source_val,
    url_path_val,
    doc_title_val,
    int(chunk_size_val),
    crawled_at_str,           # pass string, cast to timestamptz with `::timestamptz`
    embedding_str
)
```

Here the parameter `$10` is still a string, but you add `::timestamptz` to tell Postgres to parse it. Make sure your string is a valid format (like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` or with an offset `+00:00`).

---

### Which Approach Is Better?

- **Parsing in Python** ensures you have a validated `datetime` (so you can manipulate or log it).
- **Casting in SQL** is simpler if you always store an ISO8601 string and never need to manipulate it as a Python `datetime`.

Either way, you must **not** pass a string to a `timestamptz` column without telling asyncpg or Postgres how to interpret it. Once you do one of these two solutions, that error goes away.

Below is a **complete example** of how to parse `crawled_at` from your `chunk.metadata`, convert it to a real Python `datetime` via `dateutil.parser.isoparse()`, and then pass that to your Postgres `timestamptz` column. This snippet assumes you have already added a **`crawled_at timestamptz`** column to your `crawl4ai_chunks` table.

```python
import dateutil.parser

async def insert_chunk(chunk: ProcessedChunk):
    if not pool:
        raise RuntimeError("DB connection pool is not initialized.")
    try:
        # Convert the embedding list to a pgvector string
        embedding_str = to_pgvector_str(chunk.embedding)

        # Extract standard metadata fields from chunk.metadata
        source_val     = chunk.metadata.get("source", None)
        url_path_val   = chunk.metadata.get("url_path", None)
        doc_title_val  = chunk.metadata.get("doc_title", None)
        chunk_size_val = chunk.metadata.get("chunk_size", 0)

        # Here we parse crawled_at if it's a string, else None
        crawled_at_str = chunk.metadata.get("crawled_at", None)
        if crawled_at_str is not None:
            crawled_at_dt = dateutil.parser.isoparse(crawled_at_str)
        else:
            crawled_at_dt = None

        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
                  (url, chunk_number, title, summary, content,
                   source, url_path, doc_title, chunk_size, crawled_at,
                   embedding)
                VALUES
                  ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5,
                   $6, $7, $8, $9, $10,
                   $11::vector)
                """,
                # existing fields
                chunk.url,
                chunk.chunk_number,
                chunk.title,
                chunk.summary,
                chunk.content,

                # new "indexed" columns
                source_val,
                url_path_val,
                doc_title_val,
                int(chunk_size_val),
                crawled_at_dt,        # Pass the Python datetime object

                # pgvector embedding
                embedding_str
            )

        print(f"Inserted chunk {chunk.chunk_number} for {chunk.url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error inserting chunk: {e}")
```

### Where This Goes

1. **Inside your** `insert_chunk()` function, **after** you retrieve `chunk.metadata` and **before** you do the actual SQL insert.
2. Make sure you `import dateutil.parser` at the top of the file.

### What It Does

- **`crawled_at_str = chunk.metadata.get("crawled_at")`** obtains the string from the dictionary.
- **`dateutil.parser.isoparse(crawled_at_str)`** transforms something like `"2025-01-22T22:18:52.611546+00:00"` into a Python `datetime.datetime` object with UTC offset.
- Passing that `datetime` to asyncpg automatically stores it in your `timestamptz` column with no error.

Now you’ll have a properly typed `crawled_at` in Postgres, with all the benefits of `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`.

Indexing a column speeds up queries filtering or sorting on that column, but every index has overhead. Here’s why:

**Pros** of indexing a column:

1. **Faster lookups** – If you frequently query `WHERE doc_title = '...'` or `WHERE crawled_at >= ...`, an index can dramatically reduce query time.
2. **Optimized sorts and joins** – If you often `ORDER BY crawled_at`, or join on `source`, indexes help the planner find rows quickly.

**Cons** of indexing everything:

1. **Slower writes** – Each insert or update must also update every index, so too many indexes can hurt insert performance.
2. **Increased storage** – Each index takes disk space (sometimes large, especially if the column values are big).
3. **Maintenance overhead** – Vacuuming or reindexing can be more frequent if you have numerous or large indexes.

**When not to index**:

- If a column is rarely filtered or sorted on. (Queries never say `WHERE chunk_size = 500` or `ORDER BY chunk_size`).
- If a column has extremely high write rates and the overhead of maintaining an index outweighs the benefit.
- If the column is nearly always used in a full-table scan anyway (e.g. a Boolean column in a 98%/2% distribution might not be selective enough for an index to help).

In short, you create indexes where **they will actually help query performance**. Storing every possible index can bloat your database, slow down writes, and waste space.

For a typical **agentic RAG** use case, you’ll primarily query by a few fields—maybe by domain (`source`), document title (`doc_title`), or recency (`crawled_at`). Meanwhile, columns like `chunk_size` or `summary` are unlikely to appear in your where-clause filters. Below are some **common** RAG-oriented indexing decisions:

1. **`embedding`**
   - This is a **vector index** for similarity search. You’d typically create a special **pgvector** index (not a standard B-tree) so you can do approximate or exact nearest-neighbor queries. For example:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
       ON crawl4ai_chunks
       USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
       WITH (lists = 100);
     ```
     *(Tune `lists`, `probes`, etc. based on your data size and performance goals.)*

2. **`source`** (text)
   - If you often do `WHERE source = 'supabase.com'` or `WHERE source IN (...)`, then **index it**. If you rarely filter by domain, you can skip. Usually with RAG, you might want to quickly isolate “docs from domain X,” so a B-tree on `source` is helpful.
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source ON crawl4ai_chunks(source);
     ```

3. **`doc_title`** (text)
   - If you typically do `WHERE doc_title = 'AI & Vectors'` or partial text matches, an index might help. If you only store the doc title to show in results (and rarely filter by it), you can skip.
   - If you do exact matches, a regular B-tree is fine. If you do partial matches, consider a GIN or trigram index. Typically doc titles are short, so a B-tree often suffices.

4. **`crawled_at`** (timestamptz)
   - If you expect queries like `WHERE crawled_at > some_date` to filter for recency, index it:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled ON crawl4ai_chunks(crawled_at);
     ```

5. **`url_path`** (text)
   - This might be helpful if you do `WHERE url_path = '/docs/guides/ai'` or want to filter by certain subpaths. If that’s a common scenario, index it. If not, you can skip it.

6. **Other columns**:
   - `chunk_size`: Rarely used in filters or sorts, so typically not indexed.
   - `title`, `summary`, `content`: You’d more likely do a **full-text search** approach rather than a B-tree. If you’re primarily retrieving by vector similarity, you can skip B-tree indexes.
   - `created_at`: Only index if you do frequent queries by creation time.

### Minimal Recommendation

- **Vector index** on `embedding` for similarity search.
- **B-tree index** on `source` if you often filter by domain.
- Possibly **B-tree index** on `doc_title` if you do doc-level queries (`doc_title='Getting Started'`).
- **B-tree index** on `crawled_at` if you want recency queries (`WHERE crawled_at >= now() - interval '7 days'`).

That is usually enough for a typical RAG scenario. If you find you rarely need certain filters, skip those indexes to avoid overhead.

can you explain this a bit more? are you suggesting another column in additon to the embedding column that already exists?

This is a vector index for similarity search. You’d typically create a special pgvector index (not a standard B-tree) so you can do approximate or exact nearest-neighbor queries. For example:

CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 100);

(Tune lists, probes, etc. based on your data size and performance goals.)

No, you **don’t** need to create another embedding column. You already have the `embedding vector` column in your table, so you simply add a **special index** on **that same column** using `USING ivfflat (embedding ...)`.

### How pgvector Indexes Work

- **pgvector** is a Postgres extension that stores vectors (i.e., float arrays).
- For similarity search, you can’t use a normal B-tree index. Instead, you use a specialized index type—like **`ivfflat`**—for nearest-neighbor queries.

In other words, you’re telling Postgres:

> “Create an **ivfflat** index on the existing `embedding` column so we can do efficient `vector <-> vector` similarity lookups.”

### Example

If your `crawl4ai_chunks` table has:

```sql
embedding vector,  -- e.g. dimension=384
```

then you can do:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 100);
```

- **`lists = 100`** is a tuning parameter for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) performance. You can experiment with that number or use `lists = 1000`, depending on data size.

### Summary of Steps

1. **No new column** needed. Just keep your `embedding vector`.
2. **Install and enable pgvector** (you’ve likely done this).
3. **Create** an ivfflat index on that column with the desired operator class (e.g., `vector_l2_ops` if you want L2 distance).
4. **Query** with the special `<->` or `<#>` operators for distance or approximate nearest neighbor.

This index speeds up queries like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM crawl4ai_chunks
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.023, 0.45, ...]'  -- your query vector
LIMIT 10;
```

So you only need **one** embedding column, plus the special index on it.

When creating an **IVFFLAT** index for pgvector, you pick a `lists` parameter (and optionally `probes`) that balances recall (i.e., how accurate or “precise” the nearest-neighbor search is) vs. query speed. Higher `lists` typically yields better accuracy at the cost of slower insert speed and higher memory usage.

For **your** setup—a high-end CPU (Ryzen 9 7950X3D, 32 cores) plus an RTX 4090 (for embeddings)—you can start with a **larger `lists`** value, like 1,000 to 2,000, if you want high recall. Here’s the typical approach:

1. **Start around `lists=1000`.**\
   This is a fairly large number that often strikes a decent balance for mid- to large-sized datasets.

2. **Test queries** – measure both latency and accuracy. If your queries are still fast enough and you want even higher recall, try `lists=2000`. If you find the queries slow down too much, reduce the number.

3. **Tune `probes`** – Once you have a `lists` baseline, you can tweak `SET ivfflat.probes = ...` at query time.
   - More `probes` = better recall but slower queries, because the engine searches more lists.
   - Fewer `probes` = faster queries but slightly less accuracy.

For instance:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);
```

Then you might do (at query time):

```sql
SET ivfflat.probes = 10;  -- Or 20, etc.
```

Use bigger `lists` if you have:

- A **larger** dataset (tens/hundreds of thousands of chunks or more).
- Sufficient memory/CPU for more complex queries.
- A strong need for high recall in approximate nearest neighbor search.

**Summary**:

- **Starting** with `lists=1000` is a common approach for a robust system like yours.
- If that’s too slow or not accurate enough, adjust up or down. You can tune `probes` to trade off query speed vs. recall.
- There’s **no “one size fits all”**: ideally, run a small benchmark with your actual data and typical query load.
- But your hardware is powerful, so leaning toward a higher `lists` (1k–2k) is a good starting point for high precision.

NOTICE:  ivfflat index created with little data
DETAIL:  This will cause low recall.
HINT:  Drop the index until the table has more data.

Query 1 ERROR at Line 1: : ERROR:  memory required is 83 MB, maintenance_work_mem is 64 MB

<time datetime="2025-01-22T22:37:02.290Z" title="1/23/2025, 7:37:02 AM">07:37</time>

Those messages mean two things:

1. **“Little data” notice**: You’re creating an IVFFLAT index on a table that doesn’t yet have many rows. This reduces recall since IVFFLAT partitions vectors into “lists” that rely on the data distribution. With very few rows, the index can’t effectively partition. In practice, you can either:

   - **Wait** until you have more data and then create the index (the recommended approach); or
   - **Ignore** the notice if you’re just testing. The index will still work, just with lower recall.

2. **“memory required is 83 MB, maintenance\_work\_mem is 64 MB”**: During index build, Postgres can’t allocate enough memory. By default, `maintenance_work_mem` is often set to 64 MB. The IVFFLAT index build wants \~83 MB. You can increase `maintenance_work_mem` for the session or the entire instance:

   ```sql
   -- Increase for the current session:
   SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';

   -- Then create the index
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
     ON crawl4ai_chunks
     USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
     WITH (lists = 1000);
   ```

   Or globally (in postgresql.conf or via ALTER SYSTEM):

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();  -- reloads the changed setting
   ```

   Then you can re-run the `CREATE INDEX` command.

### Why These Messages Appear

- **Low data** = the partitioning algorithm (IVF) can’t effectively cluster vectors. Once your table has thousands or millions of rows, the index becomes more meaningful for approximate nearest-neighbor queries.
- **Insufficient memory** = building large indexes can require more RAM than typical B-Tree indices. With IVFFLAT, the more lists you specify and the more data you have, the more memory is used during build. Setting a higher `maintenance_work_mem` helps Postgres build large indexes more quickly and avoid out-of-memory errors.

### Practical Steps

1. **Optionally wait** until your embedding table has enough rows to make the IVFFLAT index valuable.
2. **Increase** `maintenance_work_mem` to at least the required memory or a bit more (e.g., 128MB or 256MB).
3. **Create the index**. The notice about “little data” goes away when you have enough rows, and you won’t see memory errors if your `maintenance_work_mem` is high enough.

**Bottom line**: Raise `maintenance_work_mem` and possibly wait until you’ve ingested a decent portion of your embedding data before building the IVFFLAT index.

If you still see `maintenance_work_mem = 64 MB` despite trying to raise it, it likely means Postgres isn’t actually using your new setting. Here are the most common reasons and how to fix them:

---

## 1. Make Sure You’re a Superuser or an Admin

**Changing** `maintenance_work_mem` to a higher value typically requires superuser (or a user with the right privileges) to modify the server parameters. If your user doesn’t have enough privileges, your `SET` or `ALTER SYSTEM` command may be ignored.

**Check**:

```sql
SHOW is_superuser;
```

If `off`, you might not have the permission to persist that setting.

---

## 2. Use the **Same Session** for `SET` and `CREATE INDEX`

If you do:

```sql
-- Session 1
SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';
```

Then create the index in **another** session (Session 2), the new value won’t carry over. You need:

```sql
-- same session:
SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);
```

If you’re using a script or tool that re-connects for each command, it might revert to default.

---

## 3. Confirm the Setting Actually Changed

Run:

```sql
SHOW maintenance_work_mem;
```

If it still says `64MB`, your `SET` or `ALTER SYSTEM` didn’t apply.

### If using `ALTER SYSTEM` approach:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '256MB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf(); 
SHOW maintenance_work_mem;
```

If it still says `64MB`, your server might not allow `ALTER SYSTEM` or you need to modify `postgresql.conf` directly.

---

## 4. Possibly Add `LOCAL` if in a Transaction

If you’re inside a transaction by default, you might need:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';
CREATE INDEX ...
COMMIT;
```

**Note**: `SET LOCAL` only persists within the transaction. If you do a plain `SET` inside a transaction, it can fail or revert at commit.

---

## 5. Lower `lists` if You Can’t Raise Memory

If you truly can’t increase `maintenance_work_mem` (e.g. on a managed service that won’t allow it), you can reduce `lists` or do a partial approach:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 200);
```

But that reduces recall/accuracy in your approximate nearest neighbor search.

---

### TL;DR

To fix the error:

1. **Ensure** you’re superuser (or an admin role with the correct privileges).
2. **Use** either:
   ```sql
   -- same session:
   SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';
   CREATE INDEX ...
   ```
   or
   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';
   SELECT pg_reload_conf();
   ```
3. **Verify** with `SHOW maintenance_work_mem;` in the *same session*.
4. Re-run `CREATE INDEX`.
5. If you still can’t get more than 64MB, lower `lists` for the index or chunk your data (e.g. build index after more data is loaded).

That ensures Postgres sees your updated memory setting during the entire index build.

**Congratulations** on getting the pgvector index creation working! With that in place, you can now do fast approximate nearest-neighbor lookups for your agentic RAG queries. Here are some **additional considerations** you might find helpful:

---

## 1. **Tune Your Vector Queries**

1. **`SET ivfflat.probes = n`** – Once you have your IVFFLAT index, you can control the recall vs. speed tradeoff by adjusting `probes` at query time. For instance:
   ```sql
   SET ivfflat.probes = 10;  -- or 50, 100, etc.
   SELECT * 
   FROM crawl4ai_chunks
   ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'  -- your query vector
   LIMIT 10;
   ```
   - A larger `probes` value typically improves recall but also increases query time.
   - Experiment to see what’s ideal for your data and query patterns.

2. **Distance Operator** – By default, `embedding <-> query` uses L2 distance. If you want cosine similarity, make sure you built the index with `vector_cosine_ops` (and that your queries use `<=>` or a relevant operator).

---

## 2. **Fill Your Table First**

- **IVFFLAT** partitions data points into “lists.” The initial index build is more effective when you already have a decent chunk of data.
- If you plan to ingest a large dataset, do that first, then build the index. Or **rebuild** the index after ingestion for the best partition quality.

---

## 3. **Maintenance** and Growing Data

- As you add more rows, Postgres will automatically place new vectors into the index, but the partitioning remains the same from the initial build.
- If your dataset distribution drastically changes or you significantly grow beyond your original size, you might consider **reindexing** so that partitioning adapts to your new data (especially if you notice recall dropping).
  ```sql
  REINDEX INDEX idx_chunks_embedding;
  ```
- If you prefer a once-and-done approach, you can wait until you have most of your data loaded, then build your index.

---

## 4. **Other Indexes for Metadata**

- If you want to filter by domain (`source`) or date range (`crawled_at`), you already know to add B-tree indexes. That ensures queries like:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM crawl4ai_chunks
  WHERE source = 'supabase.com'
  ORDER BY embedding <-> '[...]'
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
  can use both a B-tree index on `source` (for the filter) and the IVFFLAT index on `embedding` for similarity.

---

## 5. **Agentic RAG Pipeline Integration**

1. **Ingestion**: you produce embeddings, store them in `crawl4ai_chunks(embedding)`, and keep the text in `content` or similar columns.
2. **Nearest-Neighbor Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT *, embedding <-> '[some query vector]' AS distance
   FROM crawl4ai_chunks
   WHERE source = 'supabase.com'   -- optional filter
   ORDER BY embedding <-> '[some query vector]'
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. **LLM Prompt**: combine the top results and feed them to your Large Language Model.

---

## 6. **Monitor Resource Usage**

- Larger `lists` or `probes` can consume more CPU/RAM at query time. On a strong machine, that’s usually fine, but keep an eye on concurrency.
- If you see performance issues, you might reduce concurrency or set a smaller `lists` or `probes` default.

---

### Summary

With **maintenance\_work\_mem** set high enough to build the index, your IVFFLAT approach working, and your columns properly indexed, you’re well-prepared for a scalable agentic RAG pipeline. Going forward, just keep an eye on your **index** (reindex if the distribution changes drastically), **resource usage** (especially if concurrency is high), and **query** parameters (`probes`, `lists`) to tune speed vs. recall. Enjoy your new vector-accelerated RAG database!

# Supabase Document Crawler & Embedding Pipeline

This repository contains a Python script that:

1. **Crawls** a list of URLs from a sitemap (in this case, the [Supabase](https://supabase.com) docs)
2. **Removes** boilerplate lines from each page’s markdown (navigation links, repeated images, etc.)
3. **Splits** the cleaned text into sentence-based chunks (with overlap)
4. **Generates** embeddings for each chunk using a local [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) model on GPU
5. **Stores** each chunk in a Postgres database, including a `vector` column (via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)) for similarity search
6. **Indexes** the embedding column for approximate nearest neighbor queries, plus optional indexes on metadata columns for quick lookups

## Features

- **Sentence-based chunking** with overlap to preserve context across chunk boundaries.
- **Boilerplate removal** for known repeated lines (nav links, icons, etc.).
- **Title & summary extraction** per chunk using an LLM via local [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) calls.
- **Embeddings** from [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) on a local GPU (RTX 4090).
- **Pgvector integration**: store chunk embeddings in a `vector` column and query them with approximate nearest neighbor indexes (IVFFLAT).
- **Retry logic** when crawling pages, concurrency limiting to avoid overloading resources.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **Conda environment** or pip environment recommended
3. **NLTK** data (especially `'punkt'`) for sentence splitting
4. **asyncpg**, [SentenceTransformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), [Playwright or `crawl4ai`](https://github.com/crawl4ai/...), [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
5. A **Postgres** database with the [pgvector extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) enabled
6. [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) server running locally at `localhost:11434` (for the summary extraction)

## Installation

1. **Clone** this repo or place the script in your project folder.
2. **Conda** (or pip) install:
   ```bash
   conda create -n crawl4ai python=3.10
   conda activate crawl4ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or manually: asyncpg, nltk, sentence-transformers, httpx, etc.
   ```
3. **Download NLTK** data (including `'punkt'`):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('all')
   # or at least:
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```
4. **Set up** your Postgres database:
   - Enable pgvector: `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`
   - Create the table(s). (See [Database Schema](#database-schema).)
5. **Check** that Ollama is installed and running:
   - `curl http://localhost:11434/api/version` to verify.

## Configuration

1. **Edit** `configs/docs_supabase.yml` with your sitemap URL, if needed:
   ```yaml
   sitemap_url: https://supabase.com/docs/sitemap.xml
   ```
2. **Environment variables**:
   - `SUPABASE_USER`, `SUPABASE_PASSWORD`, etc. are set in your `.env` or loaded via Docker/production environment.
   - The script references them in the code (`SUPABASE_USER`, `SUPABASE_HOST`, etc.).
3. **Indexes**: after you load data, consider creating an IVFFLAT index for your embedding column. Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
     ON crawl4ai_chunks
     USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
     WITH (lists = 1000);
   ```

## Running the Script

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate crawl4ai

# Run the script
python3 crawl.py  # or your script name

# It will:
# 1) Load config
# 2) Crawl the sitemap
# 3) Insert pages & chunk data into Postgres
```

You should see logs like:

```
Found 2023 URLs to crawl.
Successfully crawled (attempt 1): https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai
Upserted raw markdown to crawl4ai_pages ...
Inserted chunk 0 for https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai
...
```

## Database Schema

You might have two tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_pages (
  id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
  page_url      text    UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  raw_markdown  text    NOT NULL,
  created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  last_modified timestamptz
);

CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_chunks (
  id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
  url           text    NOT NULL,
  chunk_number  int     NOT NULL,
  title         text,
  summary       text,
  content       text,
  source        text,
  url_path      text,
  doc_title     text,
  chunk_size    int,
  crawled_at    timestamptz,
  embedding     vector(384),  -- dimension must match your embedding model
  created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Optionally add indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source    ON crawl4ai_chunks(source);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_doc_title ON crawl4ai_chunks(doc_title);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled   ON crawl4ai_chunks(crawled_at);

-- For vector similarity
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);
```

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. **Memory for IVFFLAT**
   - If you see `ERROR: memory required is 83 MB, maintenance_work_mem is 64 MB`, raise your `maintenance_work_mem` or reduce `lists`.
2. **Low Recall Notice**
   - If your table is nearly empty, pgvector warns “created with little data.” You can ignore it until you have more rows.
3. **Overlapping**
   - We repeat the last 2 sentences from each chunk in the next chunk to preserve context. Tweak `sentence_overlap`.
4. **Boilerplate**
   - Adjust `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` for extra lines or icons you want to skip.
5. **Retries**
   - The script will retry each URL up to 2 times if it fails. Increase or decrease as needed.
6. **Ollama**
   - The script calls `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` for chunk titles & summaries. Ensure Ollama is running or remove that step if not needed.

**Enjoy** your agentic RAG pipeline! With this script, you can rapidly ingest site docs, chunk them at sentence boundaries, embed them, and store them for similarity search. If you need further customizations (like hooking up a custom LLM or chunking strategy), it’s easy to adapt this base code.

Below is a **technical document** that thoroughly explains the pipeline, step by step, including how each major function works, how data flows through the script, and key design decisions. It’s meant for your future self (or any other contributor) who may pick it up again months from now.

# Technical Documentation for Supabase Document Crawler & Embedding Pipeline

## Overview

This script implements an **end-to-end** pipeline for:

1. **Crawling** a list of site URLs (from a sitemap),
2. **Retrieving** raw Markdown from each page,
3. **Cleaning** out boilerplate lines,
4. **Splitting** the cleaned text into sentence-based chunks with overlap,
5. **Generating** embeddings for each chunk using a local GPU (via SentenceTransformers),
6. **Storing** each chunk in Postgres with a `vector` column (pgvector) plus standard columns for metadata.

You can then run approximate nearest neighbor or exact similarity queries against the stored embeddings, enabling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for LLM-based applications.

---

## High-Level Flow

1. **Configuration**:
   - Loads from `.env` and `docs_supabase.yml`.
   - Sets up DB credentials, the sitemap URL, concurrency, etc.

2. **Sitemap Parsing**:
   - Reads `sitemap.xml` for the site (like `https://supabase.com/docs/sitemap.xml`) to get a list of `(loc, lastmod)` pairs.

3. **Crawl**:
   - Uses an `AsyncWebCrawler` (`arun`) to load each URL’s content in parallel, up to `max_concurrent`.
   - On success, the raw markdown is upserted into `crawl4ai_pages`, then chunked/embedded.

4. **Boilerplate Removal**:
   - `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` strips out repeated nav lines, icons, etc.
   - This ensures each chunk mostly contains real doc text.

5. **Sentence-Based Chunking**:
   - `chunk_text_by_sentence()` uses NLTK’s `sent_tokenize()`.
   - Groups \~800 characters per chunk, repeating the last 2 sentences as “overlap” to preserve context across chunk boundaries.

6. **Title & Summary**:
   - For each chunk, `get_title_and_summary()` calls a local Ollama endpoint (`/api/generate`) with a prompt to produce a short JSON object.
   - The script tries to parse the JSON for a “title” and “summary.” On parsing error, it falls back to the raw text.

7. **Embeddings**:
   - `get_embedding()` uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` on GPU.
   - The resulting float array is stored in the `embedding vector(384)` column.

8. **Insert into DB**:
   - `insert_chunk()` uses SQL to store each chunk’s text, metadata, and embedding.
   - The script auto-parses the `crawled_at` string into a Python `datetime`, which is inserted as `timestamptz`.

9. **Indexes**:
   - Postgres indexes can be created on columns like `source` or `doc_title` (B-tree).
   - For approximate nearest neighbor, an `ivfflat` index on `embedding` is recommended:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
       ON crawl4ai_chunks
       USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
       WITH (lists = 1000);
     ```

---

## Detailed Components

### 1) `main()` and Initialization

- **`main()`** is the starting point:
  - Creates an asyncpg **connection pool** to Postgres.
  - Calls `get_pydantic_ai_docs_urls()` to parse the sitemap and build a list of `(url, lastmod)`.
  - If no URLs, it exits. Otherwise, calls `crawl_parallel()`.

### 2) `crawl_parallel()`

- We define a concurrency limit (`max_concurrent`) via an `asyncio.Semaphore`.
- For each URL, we do up to **2 attempts** in case of transient crawler issues.
- On success:
  1. **Upserts** the raw markdown into `crawl4ai_pages`.
  2. Calls `process_and_store_document()` to chunk + embed.

**Why 2 attempts?** Minimizes random network or browser issues from permanently failing a page.

### 3) `insert_crawled_page()`

- Upserts into the `crawl4ai_pages` table.
- If `page_url` already exists, we update the `raw_markdown` and timestamps (`created_at`, `last_modified`).
- This ensures we have a record of the entire raw doc, separate from chunk-level data.

### 4) `process_and_store_document()`

- **Removes** boilerplate lines (like repeated nav or icons).
- **Extracts** a doc-level title (the first `# Heading`).
- **Sentence-chunks** it via `chunk_text_by_sentence()`:
  1. Splits into sentences (`nltk.sent_tokenize()`).
  2. Bundles them up to \~800 chars.
  3. Overlaps the last 2 sentences in the next chunk.
- For each chunk, we do `process_chunk()` and then `insert_chunk()`.

### 5) `process_chunk()`

- For that chunk:
  1. **Gets** a short “title” & “summary” from local LLM (`get_title_and_summary()`).
  2. **Embeds** the chunk (`get_embedding()`).
  3. Builds `metadata`: `source`, `doc_title`, `chunk_size`, plus a fresh `crawled_at` timestamp.

**Note**: The “doc\_title” is from the doc-level heading; the chunk “title” is from the LLM’s extraction, which might differ.

### 6) `insert_chunk()`

- This is the final step for each chunk.
- We parse `metadata["crawled_at"]` into a **Python datetime** (so Postgres sees a `timestamptz` instead of a string).
- Convert the embedding list to a `[0.12, 0.05, ...]` string for pgvector.
- Insert rows into `crawl4ai_chunks`, with columns:
  - `url`, `chunk_number` (unique per doc)
  - `title`, `summary`, `content`
  - `source`, `url_path`, `doc_title`, `chunk_size`, `crawled_at`
  - `embedding` (the actual vector)

### 7) The `crawl4ai_chunks` Table

- For RAG queries, you typically do:
  ```sql
  SELECT *,
         embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]' AS distance
  FROM crawl4ai_chunks
  ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
  Or an approximate index approach with `ivfflat`.
- You can also filter, e.g. `WHERE source = 'supabase.com' AND doc_title = 'Cron'`.

---

## Additional Implementation Notes

1. **nltk.download('all')** – The script forcibly downloads all NLTK data, ensuring `'punkt'` or `'punkt_tab'` are available.
2. **Date parsing** – We rely on `dateutil.parser.isoparse()` for `last_modified` from the sitemap, plus we store a fresh `crawled_at` each chunk.
3. **Ollama** – The `get_title_and_summary()` function calls `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`. If you don’t run Ollama, you might remove or mock this step.
4. **Performance** – Setting concurrency too high can stress your machine. The script uses `max_concurrent=5` by default. Adjust to your hardware.
5. **Index building** – If you have minimal data, you may see “NOTICE: ivfflat index created with little data.” That’s normal. For large data, you may need to raise `maintenance_work_mem`.

```

## Summary

The script is a robust pipeline for ingestion + chunk-level embedding storage. By reading through these steps months later, you’ll recall how:

- **Crawling** is done with concurrency and retry,
- **Boilerplate** lines are stripped,
- **Sentence** chunking ensures natural text boundaries,
- **Embeddings** are stored in a `vector` column,
- **RAG** queries become trivial with Postgres + pgvector indexing.

Any future expansions—like different embedding models, more advanced LLM summarization, or additional metadata columns—can fit seamlessly into these steps. Enjoy your updated doc, and happy crawling/embedding!

Below is a **deeper dive** into the technical design of this crawler + embedding pipeline. It offers **intricate details** of how each subsystem works, advanced tips you might not remember later, and some “under the hood” features that may not be obvious at first.

---

# Technical Documentation (Extended)

## 1. Overall Purpose

This pipeline ingests documentation from a provided sitemap, cleans it, splits it into chunks on sentence boundaries, and generates vector embeddings for similarity search (RAG scenario). The script is built for a local GPU environment (using PyTorch + SentenceTransformers) and Postgres with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

**Key Distinctions**:

- **Document-level** vs. **Chunk-level** data:
  - The entire Markdown of a doc is stored in `crawl4ai_pages` for auditing or fallback.
  - The chunked embeddings are in `crawl4ai_chunks`. Each chunk can be a few sentences, with a small summary from the LLM.
- **`crawled_at`** vs. **`last_modified`** from the sitemap:
  - `last_modified` is what the server (sitemap) claims.
  - `crawled_at` is the local time we processed the chunk, stored as a real `timestamptz`.

---

## 2. Concurrency & Retrying

**Concurrency**:

- We use `asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent=5)` to limit how many pages are crawled at once.
- This prevents overloading the system (browser + GPU + DB) with too many tasks.

**Retry Logic**:

- Each URL is attempted up to 2 times in `crawl_parallel()`. If a crawler or network error occurs, we try again.
- This helps with intermittent failures. After 2 attempts, we log “Gave up.”

**Advanced**:

- If you see “Target page, context or browser has been closed,” you might reduce concurrency or break the crawl into smaller batches.

---

## 3. Crawler (`AsyncWebCrawler`)

We rely on [`crawler.arun()`](https://...) to fetch each URL’s content. Each run returns a `CrawlResult`:

- `result.markdown_v2.raw_markdown` → used for indexing.
- `result.success` and `result.error_message` → used for logging.

Under the hood, this likely uses Playwright or another headless browser to load the page, scrape the final DOM, and convert it to Markdown.

**Interesting**:

- The crawler sometimes includes partial code blocks or leftover JS if the site is dynamic.
- We do a second pass (`remove_boilerplate_markdown()`) to remove repeated links or icons.
- If the site has advanced content rendering, we might adjust the browser wait or hooks.

---

## 4. Data Flow: Pages → Chunks

1. `insert_crawled_page()` upserts the page-level record into `crawl4ai_pages`.
2. `process_and_store_document()`:
   - Calls `remove_boilerplate_markdown()`.
   - Extracts a doc-level heading (`extract_doc_title()`).
   - Splits the result into smaller chunks with `chunk_text_by_sentence()`.

**Why Sentence Splitting?**

- For RAG, chunking by sentence boundaries typically yields more coherent blocks for the LLM to reason about. Character-based splitting can break code blocks or partial sentences.
- We have an overlap of 2 sentences to reduce context loss. You can tune it if you see duplication or want fewer repeated lines.

---

## 5. Title & Summary Extraction

**`get_title_and_summary()`** calls `httpx.AsyncClient().post(...)` to `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` (Ollama). The prompt instructs the LLM to produce JSON:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "summary": "..."
}
```

**What if the LLM fails or returns invalid JSON?**

- The script catches `json.JSONDecodeError`, storing `"Parsing Error"` or the raw text as fallback.
- You can easily swap out Ollama for another local or remote API if you want different summarization logic.

**Performance Note**:

- Each chunk calls the LLM once. If you have thousands of chunks, that can be slow. You might want to cache or skip chunk-level summary if it's not needed.

---

## 6. Generating Embeddings

**`get_embedding()`** uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` on GPU:

- **PyTorch** is used under the hood.
- The script calls `.encode(text, device="cuda")` to produce a float array of dimension 384.
- We convert `[1.23, 4.56, ...]` into a `[1.23, 4.56, ...]` string for `INSERT ...embedding...`.

**Possible Bottlenecks**:

- Repeatedly encoding many short chunks can be slow. If you want to speed it up, you can batch them or run them in parallel. The current approach is straightforward: one chunk → one embedding.
- The GPU usage can be monitored. If you see it saturate or run out of memory, reduce concurrency or chunk size.

---

## 7. Database & pgvector

### `crawl4ai_chunks` Columns

- `id` (serial) – primary key.
- `url` – which doc page the chunk is from.
- `chunk_number` – 0, 1, 2, ... for each doc.
- `title`, `summary` – from the LLM.
- `content` – chunk text.
- `source`, `url_path`, `doc_title`, `chunk_size`, `crawled_at` – additional metadata.
- `embedding` vector(384) – the actual embedding vector.
- `created_at` timestamptz – default now().

**Insert** is done in `insert_chunk()`, which:

- **Parses** `crawled_at` from string → datetime, so Postgres sees `timestamptz`.
- **Converts** the embedding list to a string for the `vector` column.

**Indexing**:

```sql
-- approximate nearest neighbor
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);

-- B-tree for filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source    ON crawl4ai_chunks(source);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_doc_title ON crawl4ai_chunks(doc_title);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled   ON crawl4ai_chunks(crawled_at);
```

**`lists=1000`** is just a starting point. You can raise or lower based on data volume and recall needs. If you get “insufficient memory” at build time, increase `maintenance_work_mem`. If you see “NOTICE: index created with little data,” you can ignore or wait until you have more rows to rebuild.

### `crawl4ai_pages`?

- Stores the full `raw_markdown`, so you can see the doc’s entire content in one place.
- A single doc can produce many chunks in `crawl4ai_chunks`.

---

## 8. Querying the Embedding

You typically do a **similarity** or **distance** query:

```sql
-- L2 distance example
SELECT *,
       embedding <-> '[0.23, 0.91, 0.12, ...]' AS distance
FROM crawl4ai_chunks
WHERE source = 'supabase.com'
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.23, 0.91, 0.12, ...]'
LIMIT 5;
```

**In** Postgres, `<->` is the L2 operator if you used `vector_l2_ops`. If you prefer cosine similarity, define the index with `vector_cosine_ops` and query with `<=>`.

**`ivfflat.probes`** can be tuned in the session:

```sql
SET ivfflat.probes = 20;
```

More `probes` = better recall but slower queries.

---

## 9. Partial or Low Data

**If the site doesn’t have much data** or you only crawled a handful of pages, you’ll see a `NOTICE: ivfflat index created with little data`. That’s normal. The IVFFLAT partitioning is less effective with few vectors. As you ingest more docs, the index becomes more representative.

**If you run the script repeatedly** with new data, Postgres will place newly inserted vectors in the existing partitions. If that distribution changes drastically over time, consider a reindex for better partitioning.

---

## 10. Potential Edge Cases & Logs

1. **HTML or JS**: If `crawl4ai` yields weird leftover HTML, you can expand `remove_boilerplate_markdown()`.
2. **Timezones**: `crawled_at_dt = dateutil.parser.isoparse(...)` can handle offsets like `+00:00`. Everything is stored as UTC.
3. **Playwright Browser Issues**: The crawler might fail if concurrency is high or memory is low. The script logs “Exception on attempt X for URL…” and tries again.
4. **Large Summaries**: If the LLM returns more text than you want, you can adapt the prompt or chunk size.

---

## 11. Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Embeddings**: If embedding chunk-by-chunk is slow, you could gather multiple chunks, pass them in a single batch to the model.
2. **Full-Text** or **Trigram** indexes: If you want partial matching on `title` or `content`, consider a GIN or trigram index.
3. **Webhook** or **Queue**: If you want the pipeline to run in the background, you can enqueue new URLs and process them asynchronously.
4. **Multiple Summaries**: You can store multiple LLM-based fields if you want different summary styles (e.g. short summary vs. bullet summary).

---

### Final Thoughts

From fetching URLs and cleaning them, to chunk-level embeddings, to storing them in a vector column with advanced indexing, this pipeline is a blueprint for retrieval-augmented generation. You can easily adopt it to other sites, other LLM summarization steps, or additional transformations. As your data or needs grow, just tune concurrency, chunk size, overlap, or indexing parameters to keep it running smoothly.

revise this documentation to focus less on the supabase documentation aspect, since that site was just for testing, and more on this script's value as a tool for llm agents. the urls to fetch can be populated by the agent during use. that is the flexibility

# Site Crawler & RAG Embedding Pipeline

This repository contains a Python script that:

1. **Crawls** a list of URLs from a sitemap (in this case, the [Supabase](https://supabase.com) docs)
2. **Removes** boilerplate lines from each page’s markdown (navigation links, repeated images, etc.)
3. **Splits** the cleaned text into sentence-based chunks (with overlap)
4. **Generates** embeddings for each chunk using a local [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) model on GPU
5. **Stores** each chunk in a Postgres database, including a `vector` column (via [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)) for similarity search
6. **Indexes** the embedding column for approximate nearest neighbor queries, plus optional indexes on metadata columns for quick lookups

## Features

- **Sentence-based chunking** with overlap to preserve context across chunk boundaries.
- **Boilerplate removal** for known repeated lines (nav links, icons, etc.).
- **Title & summary extraction** per chunk using an LLM via local [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) calls.
- **Embeddings** from [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) on a local GPU (RTX 4090).
- **Pgvector integration**: store chunk embeddings in a `vector` column and query them with approximate nearest neighbor indexes (IVFFLAT).
- **Retry logic** when crawling pages, concurrency limiting to avoid overloading resources.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **Conda environment** or pip environment recommended
3. **NLTK** data (especially `'punkt'`) for sentence splitting
4. **asyncpg**, [SentenceTransformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), [Playwright or `crawl4ai`](https://github.com/crawl4ai/...), [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
5. A **Postgres** database with the [pgvector extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) enabled
6. [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) server running locally at `localhost:11434` (for the summary extraction)

## Installation

1. **Clone** this repo or place the script in your project folder.
2. **Conda** (or pip) install:
   ```bash
   conda create -n crawl4ai python=3.10
   conda activate crawl4ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or manually: asyncpg, nltk, sentence-transformers, httpx, etc.
   ```
3. **Download NLTK** data (including `'punkt'`):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('all')
   # or at least:
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```
4. **Set up** your Postgres database:
   - Enable pgvector: `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`
   - Create the table(s). (See [Database Schema](#database-schema).)
5. **Check** that Ollama is installed and running:
   - `curl http://localhost:11434/api/version` to verify.

## Configuration

1. **Edit** `configs/docs_supabase.yml` with your sitemap URL, if needed:
   ```yaml
   sitemap_url: https://supabase.com/docs/sitemap.xml
   ```
2. **Environment variables**:
   - `SUPABASE_USER`, `SUPABASE_PASSWORD`, etc. are set in your `.env` or loaded via Docker/production environment.
   - The script references them in the code (`SUPABASE_USER`, `SUPABASE_HOST`, etc.).
3. **Indexes**: after you load data, consider creating an IVFFLAT index for your embedding column. Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
     ON crawl4ai_chunks
     USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
     WITH (lists = 1000);
   ```

## Running the Script

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate crawl4ai

# Run the script
python3 crawl.py  # or your script name

# It will:
# 1) Load config
# 2) Crawl the sitemap
# 3) Insert pages & chunk data into Postgres
```

You should see logs like:

```
Found 2023 URLs to crawl.
Successfully crawled (attempt 1): https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai
Upserted raw markdown to crawl4ai_pages ...
Inserted chunk 0 for https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai
...
```

## Database Schema

You might have two tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_pages (
  id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
  page_url      text    UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  raw_markdown  text    NOT NULL,
  created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  last_modified timestamptz
);

CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_chunks (
  id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
  url           text    NOT NULL,
  chunk_number  int     NOT NULL,
  title         text,
  summary       text,
  content       text,
  source        text,
  url_path      text,
  doc_title     text,
  chunk_size    int,
  crawled_at    timestamptz,
  embedding     vector(384),  -- dimension must match your embedding model
  created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Optionally add indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source    ON crawl4ai_chunks(source);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_doc_title ON crawl4ai_chunks(doc_title);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled   ON crawl4ai_chunks(crawled_at);

-- For vector similarity
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);
```

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. **Memory for IVFFLAT**
   - If you see `ERROR: memory required is 83 MB, maintenance_work_mem is 64 MB`, raise your `maintenance_work_mem` or reduce `lists`.
2. **Low Recall Notice**
   - If your table is nearly empty, pgvector warns “created with little data.” You can ignore it until you have more rows.
3. **Overlapping**
   - We repeat the last 2 sentences from each chunk in the next chunk to preserve context. Tweak `sentence_overlap`.
4. **Boilerplate**
   - Adjust `remove_boilerplate_markdown()` for extra lines or icons you want to skip.
5. **Retries**
   - The script will retry each URL up to 2 times if it fails. Increase or decrease as needed.
6. **Ollama**
   - The script calls `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` for chunk titles & summaries. Ensure Ollama is running or remove that step if not needed.

**Enjoy** your agentic RAG pipeline! With this script, you can rapidly ingest site docs, chunk them at sentence boundaries, embed them, and store them for similarity search. If you need further customizations (like hooking up a custom LLM or chunking strategy), it’s easy to adapt this base code.

Below is a revised **README.md** that emphasizes this pipeline’s general applicability to LLM agents and flexible URL usage, rather than focusing on a specific site like Supabase:

---

# Site Crawler & RAG Embedding Pipeline

This repository contains a Python script that can:

1. **Crawl** a list of URLs (originally from a sitemap, but easily extended to any custom URL list),
2. **Remove** boilerplate lines or navigation content from each page’s text,
3. **Split** the cleaned text into sentence-based chunks with optional overlap (for coherent context),
4. **Generate** embeddings for each chunk using a local [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) model on GPU (e.g., an RTX 4090),
5. **Store** each chunk in a Postgres database, including a `vector` column ([pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)) for similarity search,
6. **Index** the embedding column for approximate nearest neighbor queries and optionally index other metadata for quick lookups.

This script is particularly useful in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** scenarios, where an LLM agent needs up-to-date or domain-specific textual data. You can dynamically populate the URLs to be crawled so the agent can fetch and embed new content on the fly.

---

## Key Features

- **Flexible URL Ingestion**: Provide a list of URLs (originally from a sitemap, but can be from anywhere) for the agent to crawl.
- **Boilerplate Removal**: Removes repeated nav lines, icons, etc., letting the agent focus on the actual document content.
- **Sentence-Based Chunking**: Splits text by sentence boundaries, with optional overlap of multiple sentences.
- **LLM Title & Summary**: Each chunk can optionally receive a short “title” and “summary” from a local LLM, e.g. via [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama).
- **GPU Embeddings**: Uses [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) from SentenceTransformers on CUDA.
- **Pgvector**: Stores chunk embeddings in a `vector` column for approximate nearest neighbor queries.
- **Retry & Concurrency**: Retries failed URLs up to 2 times, with a configurable concurrency limit.

---

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **Conda** (or pip) environment recommended.
3. **NLTK** data (especially `'punkt'`) for sentence splitting.
4. **asyncpg**, [SentenceTransformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers), [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/), plus any crawler library or custom code ([Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [`crawl4ai`](https://github.com/crawl4ai/), etc.).
5. A **Postgres** database with the [pgvector extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) enabled.
6. [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) (or another local LLM endpoint) if you want chunk-level summarization.
7. (Optional) GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) for faster embeddings.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone** or copy this script into your project.
2. **Set up** a Conda environment (or pip):
   ```bash
   conda create -n crawl4ai python=3.10
   conda activate crawl4ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or your custom dependencies
   ```
3. **Download NLTK** data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')   # ensures sentence tokenization works
   ```
4. **Set up** Postgres with pgvector:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION vector;  -- in your database
   ```
5. (Optional) **Check** your LLM endpoint (like Ollama) is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/version
   ```

---

## Configuration

- **.env** or environment variables:
  - Database credentials: `SUPABASE_USER`, `SUPABASE_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_HOST`, `SUPABASE_PORT`, `SUPABASE_DB`.
  - Or update them directly in the script.
- **Sitemap vs. Agent’s URL List**:
  - Out of the box, this script reads a sitemap file (`docs_supabase.yml` by default).
  - You can easily adapt it so an agent provides the URL list at runtime instead.
- **Indices**:
  - Once data is stored, create an IVFFLAT index for the embeddings:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
      ON crawl4ai_chunks
      USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
      WITH (lists = 1000);
    ```
  - You may also want B-tree indexes on columns like `source` or `crawled_at`.

---

## Usage

1. **Activate environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate crawl4ai
   ```

2. **Run** the script:
   ```bash
   python3 crawl.py
   ```
   - By default, it loads the sitemap from `configs/docs_supabase.yml`.
   - If you want your own URL list, modify `get_pydantic_ai_docs_urls()` or pass in a custom function that provides `(url, last_modified)` pairs.

3. **Watch logs**:
   ```
   Found 50 URLs to crawl.
   Successfully crawled: ...
   Inserted chunk 0 for ...
   ```

4. **Check** your Postgres tables:
   ```sql
   SELECT url, title, summary, embedding
   FROM crawl4ai_chunks
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

5. **Query** with vector search:
   ```sql
   SET ivfflat.probes = 10;  -- tune number of probes
   SELECT content,
          embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.88, ...]' AS distance
     FROM crawl4ai_chunks
   ```

ORDER BY embedding <-> '\[0.12, 0.88, ...]'
LIMIT 5;

````

---

## Database Schema

You can store entire raw docs in `crawl4ai_pages` and chunk-level data in `crawl4ai_chunks`. An example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_pages (
id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
page_url      text    UNIQUE NOT NULL,
raw_markdown  text    NOT NULL,
created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
last_modified timestamptz
);

CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_chunks (
id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
url           text    NOT NULL,
chunk_number  int     NOT NULL,
title         text,
summary       text,
content       text,
source        text,
url_path      text,
doc_title     text,
chunk_size    int,
crawled_at    timestamptz,
embedding     vector(384),
created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Optional indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source    ON crawl4ai_chunks(source);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled   ON crawl4ai_chunks(crawled_at);

CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
ON crawl4ai_chunks
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH (lists = 1000);
````

Adjust the embedding dimension if your model differs from 384.

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. **Error: memory required X MB, maintenance\_work\_mem=64 MB**
   - Increase `maintenance_work_mem` or reduce `lists` in your IVFFLAT index creation.
2. **Low Recall**
   - If the table is nearly empty, partitioning is suboptimal. Wait for more data or reindex after ingestion.
3. **Performance**
   - If chunk-level LLM summarization is slow, remove or batch that step.
4. **Overlapping**
   - The script repeats the last 2 sentences in the next chunk to preserve context. Tweak `sentence_overlap`.
5. **Custom URL Input**
   - Replace or augment `get_pydantic_ai_docs_urls()` to let an LLM agent feed in new URLs at runtime.
6. **Local GPU usage**
   - Keep an eye on GPU memory. If you process thousands of chunks concurrently, you can saturate VRAM. Adjust concurrency or embed in smaller batches.

---

**Enjoy** this flexible pipeline for your agentic RAG tasks! You can have an agent populate fresh URLs, chunk them at sentence boundaries, embed with minimal overhead, and store them for immediate vector-based retrieval. Adjust chunk size, indexing strategy, concurrency, or the chosen LLM to fit your environment.

# LLM Agentic Crawler & Embedding Pipeline

This repository hosts a **Python script** that lets you:

1. **Crawl** a list of URLs (from a sitemap or any dynamic source),
2. **Clean** away boilerplate (nav links, repeated icons, etc.),
3. **Split** text into sentence-level chunks (with overlap for context),
4. **Generate** embeddings for each chunk (using SentenceTransformers on GPU),
5. **Store** chunks and embeddings in Postgres (with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)),
6. **Index** the embedding column for fast approximate nearest neighbor queries.

These steps form a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) pipeline, especially valuable for LLM agents that need flexible, on-demand ingestion of new URLs.

---

## Key Features

- **Agent-Friendly**: The script easily integrates with an agent’s list of URLs; it doesn’t have to rely on a single sitemap.
- **Sentence-Based Chunking**: NLTK-based tokenization ensures chunk boundaries align with sentences, preserving context.
- **Local GPU Embeddings**: Employs [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) on CUDA hardware.
- **Summaries from LLM**: Optionally calls a local [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) endpoint to extract short “title” & “summary” for each chunk.
- **Postgres + pgvector**: A single `vector` column in `crawl4ai_chunks` allows approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval with `ivfflat` indexing.
- **Concurrency & Retry**: Configurable concurrency, built-in retries to handle transient crawling errors.

**Use Case**: Quickly spin up a system that crawls arbitrary doc content, segments it, and stores embeddings for agentic knowledge retrieval.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- A **Postgres** database with [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) installed.
- **nltk**, **asyncpg**, **sentence-transformers**, **Playwright** (or the `crawl4ai` library), plus typical Python dependencies.
- **Ollama** (if you want chunk-level LLM summaries) running locally at `localhost:11434`.
- A **GPU** (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) is recommended to accelerate embedding generation.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone** the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/agentic-crawler-embeddings.git
   ```

2. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda create -n crawl4ai python=3.10
   conda activate crawl4ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download** NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')  # Minimum for sentence tokenizing
   ```

4. **Create** or update your Postgres schema (for example):
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION vector;

   CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_pages (...);
   CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_chunks (...);

   -- Optionally create indexes on embedding, etc.
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
     ON crawl4ai_chunks
     USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
     WITH (lists = 1000);
   ```

5. **Edit** `.env` or your config file to provide DB credentials and any desired concurrency limits.

6. **Run** the script:
   ```bash
   python3 crawl.py
   ```
   By default, it reads a sitemap URL from `docs_supabase.yml`—but you can adapt it to any agent-provided URLs.

---

## Usage Flow

1. **Agent** provides a list of target URLs or a sitemap.
2. **Crawler** fetches each page, up to `max_concurrent` at once, and cleans the text.
3. **Sentence Splitting**: Chunks get an overlap of 2 sentences for continuity.
4. **LLM Summaries**: Each chunk optionally calls Ollama for a short title/summary.
5. **Embeddings**: Use a local GPU to embed each chunk (dimension 384).
6. **DB Insert**: All chunk data, embeddings, and metadata are stored in Postgres.
7. **Query**: With `SELECT ... ORDER BY embedding <-> '[...]' LIMIT 5;`, you can find the top relevant chunks for an LLM or agent.

---

## Database Schema (Example)

A minimal approach includes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_pages (
  id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
  page_url      text    UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  raw_markdown  text    NOT NULL,
  created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  last_modified timestamptz
);

CREATE TABLE crawl4ai_chunks (
  id            serial PRIMARY KEY,
  url           text    NOT NULL,
  chunk_number  int     NOT NULL,
  title         text,
  summary       text,
  content       text,
  source        text,
  url_path      text,
  doc_title     text,
  chunk_size    int,
  crawled_at    timestamptz,
  embedding     vector(384),    -- for all-MiniLM-L6-v2
  created_at    timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_source    ON crawl4ai_chunks (source);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_crawled   ON crawl4ai_chunks (crawled_at);

-- Vector indexing for approximate nearest neighbor
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);
```

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. **Low Data**
   - If you see “ivfflat index created with little data,” it just means the dataset is small.
2. **Memory Errors**
   - If building the IVFFLAT index says “memory required is 83 MB, maintenance\_work\_mem is 64 MB,” increase `maintenance_work_mem` or reduce `lists`.
3. **Slow Summarization**
   - If chunk-level LLM calls are too slow, remove them or batch them.
4. **GPU**
   - Check if `device="cuda"` is recognized. If you see CPU usage instead, confirm PyTorch sees your GPU.
5. **Modifying Overlap**
   - In `chunk_text_by_sentence()`, adjust `sentence_overlap=2`. Use more or fewer sentences for continuity.
6. **Agent-provided URLs**
   - If the script currently reads from `docs_supabase.yml`, replace or extend the function that enumerates URLs with your agent’s dynamic URL list.

---

**This script** can quickly ingest new documents at the request of an LLM agent, chunk + embed them, and store them for immediate retrieval. Adapt it for your own RAG-based knowledge retrieval, or integrate it into a larger pipeline that automatically captures newly suggested URLs from an AI system.

Absolutely. **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** is a popular choice because it’s small, fast, and still fairly accurate—but there are many **larger** or **more specialized** embedding models worth considering depending on your hardware, data domain, and precision needs. Below are a few suggestions and alternatives.

---

## 1. Larger or Newer Sentence-Transformers Models

1. **all-mpnet-base-v2**
   - Dimension: 768
   - Generally outperforms MiniLM on semantic tasks, but is heavier (more memory usage, slower inference).

2. **multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1** or **multi-qa-mpnet-base-cos-v1**
   - Specifically trained for QA and retrieval tasks. Often yields better results in RAG contexts.

3. **Instructor** or **E5** models (e.g. `hkunlp/instructor-large`, `intfloat/e5-large-v2`)
   - More recent. Instructor-based models allow you to specify “instructions” with your input for improved domain adaptation. E5 is also known for strong performance on retrieval tasks.

4. **Longer-Context Models**
   - If your domain is code or very long text, you might consider specialized models (like CodeBERT for code, or specialized LLM-based embeddings). Each has trade-offs in dimension and speed.

---

## 2. Using OpenAI or Cohere Embeddings

If you prefer **API-based embeddings** rather than local GPU:

- **OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002`**
  - 1536-dimensional, widely used for chatGPT RAG. High-quality general-purpose embeddings, but requires calling the OpenAI API (latency + cost considerations).
- **Cohere’s embeddings**
  - Offers high-performance general or domain-specific embeddings, also via an API.

Pros: minimal infrastructure overhead, fairly strong performance.\
Cons: external service cost, data privacy considerations, no offline usage.

---

## 3. Using a Larger Local Model (e.g., BERT-Large or RoBERTa-Large)

- Some want maximum precision from a local model with significantly more parameters (like `bert-large-uncased` or `roberta-large`).
- Typically slower, more VRAM needed. If you have an RTX 4090, it might be feasible. But consider the diminishing returns vs. the overhead of huge models.

---

## 4. Dimensionality vs. Speed vs. Recall

- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** yields 384-d embeddings, which is quite efficient for large-scale retrieval.
- Some advanced models produce 768-d or 1024-d embeddings. That might yield a small boost in accuracy but can double or triple index size, memory usage, and query times.
- **Trade-off**: If your data is huge and you need lightning-fast searches, a smaller dimension can help. If you need top-tier accuracy or nuanced semantic matching, bigger embeddings can help.

---

## 5. Multi-Modal / Domain-Specific Embeddings

- If you have images or code (or multi-modal docs), you might consider:
  - **CLIP** (for images + text)
  - **CodeBERT** / **CodeT5** (for source code)
  - specialized BioBERT / SciBERT for domain language.
- The approach is similar: store embeddings in pgvector, build an IVFFLAT index, query with `<->`.

---

## 6. Alternate Approaches to Embedding Generation

1. **On-the-fly LLM**:
   - Some advanced RAG workflows generate embeddings from a large LLM (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) by hooking into its token embeddings. This can be slow or expensive, but might yield strong domain accuracy.

2. **Pre-embedding Summaries**:
   - Instead of embedding raw text, you might run a summarizer or “extractive highlight” step, then embed that. This can reduce token noise if your data is extremely large or repetitive.

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Combine a lexical index (like Postgres Full-Text or trigram-based) with a vector search. You run a union of lexical + vector searches to get the best of both worlds.

4. **Re-ranking**:
   - If recall is critical, you can retrieve a top-K from the approximate index, then re-rank them with a heavier or more precise model (like cross-encoder) before returning the final results. This 2-step approach can yield high accuracy.

---

## 7. Summary of Model & Approach Choices

- If your pipeline focuses on **speed** and you have **lots** of documents, **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** is a fine baseline.
- If you want more **accuracy** and can handle a slower embed time, try `all-mpnet-base-v2` or an **Instructor** model.
- If you want **serverless / easy** usage and are fine with external calls, **OpenAI’s** or **Cohere’s** embeddings are strong.
- If you have a **domain** with specialized language (bio, legal, code), a domain-specific or multi-modal model might be best.

**In short,** picking an embedding model is always a trade-off among accuracy, speed, resource usage, and domain match. The script is flexible: you can simply change the `MODEL_NAME` to any other `sentence-transformers` model (or wire in an external API), and the rest of the pipeline remains the same.

Introduction

We present NV-Embed-v2, a generalist embedding model that ranks No. 1 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB benchmark)(as of Aug 30, 2024) with a score of 72.31 across 56 text embedding tasks. It also holds the No. 1 in the retrieval sub-category (a score of 62.65 across 15 tasks) in the leaderboard, which is essential to the development of RAG technology.

NV-Embed-v2 presents several new designs, including having the LLM attend to latent vectors for better pooled embedding output, and demonstrating a two-staged instruction tuning method to enhance the accuracy of both retrieval and non-retrieval tasks. Additionally, NV-Embed-v2 incorporates a novel hard-negative mining methods that take into account the positive relevance score for better false negatives removal.

For more technical details, refer to our paper: NV-Embed: Improved Techniques for Training LLMs as Generalist Embedding Models.

Troubleshooting
1. Instruction template for MTEB benchmarks

For MTEB sub-tasks for retrieval, STS, summarization, please use the instruction prefix template in instructions.json. For classification, clustering and reranking, please use the instructions provided in Table. 7 in NV-Embed paper.
2. Required Packages

If you have trouble, try installing the python packages as below

pip uninstall -y transformer-engine
pip install torch==2.2.0
pip install transformers==4.42.4
pip install flash-attn==2.2.0
pip install sentence-transformers==2.7.0

3. How to enable Multi-GPU (Note, this is the case for HuggingFace Transformers)

from transformers import AutoModel
from torch.nn import DataParallel

embedding_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("nvidia/NV-Embed-v2")
for module_key, module in embedding_model._modules.items():
    embedding_model._modules[module_key] = DataParallel(module)

4. Fixing "nvidia/NV-Embed-v2 is not the path to a directory containing a file named config.json"

Switch to your local model path，and open config.json and change the value of "_name_or_path" and replace it with your local model path.
5. Access to model nvidia/NV-Embed-v2 is restricted. You must be authenticated to access it

Use your huggingface access token to execute "huggingface-cli login".
6. How to resolve slight mismatch in Sentence transformer results.

A slight mismatch in the Sentence Transformer implementation is caused by a discrepancy in the calculation of the instruction prefix length within the Sentence Transformer package.

To fix this issue, you need to build the Sentence Transformer package from source, making the necessary modification in this line as below.

git clone https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers.git
cd sentence-transformers
git checkout v2.7-release
# Modify L353 in SentenceTransformer.py to **'extra_features["prompt_length"] = tokenized_prompt["input_ids"].shape[-1]'**.
pip install -e .

**Yes**, you could absolutely consider **NV-Embed-v2** (or similarly advanced embeddings) as an alternative to your current model. Here’s a quick overview to help you decide if this (or a similar high-performance embedding approach) is right for you:

---

## 1. NV-Embed-v2 Overview

**NV-Embed-v2** is a large, instruction-tuned embedding model from NVIDIA, with strong retrieval performance and an MTEB benchmark score of 72.31 (making it one of the highest-performing generalist embedding models, as of the model card’s publish date). Notable details:

- **Base**: Mistral-7B-v0.1 (a decoder-only LLM)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 4096 (much larger than the 384 or 768 dimensions typical of smaller SentenceTransformers models)
- **Instruction Tuning**: Allows you to prepend an “instruction” for more domain- or task-specific embeddings (like QA, summarization, classification, etc.)
- **Hard-Negative Mining**: The model’s training approach carefully accounts for partial relevance scores to better handle false negatives.

**Implications**:

- You’ll likely see **higher-quality embeddings** on tasks such as retrieval or QA, especially with domain or instruction-based usage.
- Because it outputs 4096-dimensional vectors, it’s more demanding in storage, memory, and compute than typical 384- or 768-d embeddings.
- You’ll need to set your `vector(...)` column dimension to 4096 if you store them in pgvector. Then indexes (like `ivfflat`) become bigger, queries require more memory, etc.

---

## 2. Practical Considerations vs. all-MiniLM-L6-v2

1. **Performance**:
   - NV-Embed-v2 uses a 7B base model with specialized instruction tuning. The embeddings can significantly outperform smaller “all-\*” or “mpnet” models in many tasks, but you need **enough GPU VRAM** (and time) per forward pass.
   - In contrast, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is extremely fast and lightweight, perfect for high-volume ingestion or resource-limited environments.

2. **Dimension: 4096**
   - This is over **10x** the dimension of a 384-d model, so your storage for `embedding` columns is bigger.
   - Building IVFFLAT indexes can also require more memory in the `maintenance_work_mem`.
   - Querying might be slower (distance calculations on 4096 floats vs. 384).

3. **Instruction Prefix**:
   - NV-Embed-v2 expects you to add a small “prompt” or “instruction” string if you want the model to know the intended use case (e.g. “Given a question, retrieve relevant passages.”).
   - For doc embeddings (like an article chunk), you might pass a simpler prefix or none at all, or define your own domain instructions.
   - This can be an advantage if you want “embedding mode” for multiple tasks: retrieval, classification, summarization, etc.

4. **PyTorch Requirements**:
   - Possibly need to install `flash-attn`, a specific `transformers` version, or other specialized dependencies as listed in the model card.
   - The model code might rely on custom forward logic (like `latent-attention pooling`) to produce the correct embedding.

5. **Multi-GPU / Large-Batch**:
   - If you want to embed thousands of documents quickly, you might consider multi-GPU or data-parallel approaches. The model card mentions you can wrap modules in `DataParallel`.

---

## 3. Integration into Your Pipeline

- **Dimension**:
  - Update your `crawl4ai_chunks` table for a `vector(4096)`.
  - Rebuild your IVFFLAT index with e.g.:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
      ON crawl4ai_chunks
      USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
      WITH (lists = 1000);
    ```
  - Possibly increase `lists` or `maintenance_work_mem`.

- **Batch Embedding**:
  - You can adapt the existing batch embedding logic (`compute_batch_embeddings()`) to use the NV-Embed-v2 approach.
  - If you use `SentenceTransformer` style code, pass the instruction prefix or custom code from the model card.

- **Instructions**:
  - If you store knowledge-base doc chunks, you might do something like:
    ```python
    prefix = "Instruct: This is a retrieval doc chunk. \nText: "
    doc_texts = [prefix + c for c in chunk_texts]
    embeddings = model.encode(doc_texts, ...)
    ```
  - Or you can pass the `instruction=` argument if using the model’s custom code path.

---

## 4. Other High-Performance Embedding Options

1. **OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002**
   - If you can rely on a remote API and are okay with cost + data privacy, it’s a strong choice for general retrieval. 1536-d vectors, widely used in RAG.
2. **E5 or Instructor**
   - E5-large / E5-xl or `hkunlp/instructor-large` can sometimes rival or outperform typical open-source embeddings on various tasks, with a dimension usually 1024 or 768.
3. **multi-qa-* models*\*
   - `multi-qa-mpnet-base-cos-v1` from sentence-transformers for multi-lingual QA tasks.

---

## 5. When to Stick to all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Despite being older and smaller, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`:

- Is extremely fast & resource efficient (384 dimension → smaller DB index + lower memory usage).
- Good for large-scale ingestion if you care about speed.
- Easy to run on minimal GPU or even CPU, if performance demands aren’t too high.

---

## Conclusion

**NV-Embed-v2** is definitely an **option** if you can handle the GPU and memory overhead of a 4096-d embedding. It can yield top-tier retrieval performance, especially if you leverage the instruction-based approach. However, it **is** more complex to set up and uses significantly more resources.

**In short**: If you want the best retrieval performance and have strong hardware plus large memory, **NV-Embed-v2** is an excellent next-generation embedding model to try in your pipeline. Otherwise, more moderate models like `mpnet-base` or `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` might suffice for a great balance of speed and quality.

Below is an outline of how you might **use** the high-dimensional **NV-Embed-v2** embeddings **and** then reduce dimensionality if you run into performance or storage constraints. This approach balances the model’s state-of-the-art performance with practical concerns like database size, index build time, and query latency.

---

## 1. Use NV-Embed-v2 (4096 dims) As Is

1. **Generate 4096-d embeddings** directly from `nvidia/NV-Embed-v2`.
2. **Store** them in your `crawl4ai_chunks.embedding` column of type `vector(4096)`.
3. **Index** them using `ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)` with some `lists` value:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding
     ON crawl4ai_chunks
     USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
     WITH (lists = 1000);
   ```
4. Monitor:
   - **Index creation** might require substantial memory (`maintenance_work_mem`), given 4096-d.
   - **Query performance** might be slower than 384 or 768-d because you do distance computations on 4096 floats.
   - **DB size** also grows quickly with more rows.

If your hardware (e.g., a high-memory GPU or a big CPU server) can handle it, staying at 4096 may yield the best performance for retrieval tasks. **But** if you see large memory usage or slow queries, you can proceed with dimension reduction.

---

## 2. Offline Dimensionality Reduction

**Idea**: You still embed once with the full 4096-d model (which is your highest-fidelity data). Then, **offline** you transform those embeddings to fewer dimensions (e.g., 768, 512, or 256) before storing or indexing them. You lose some accuracy, but might see big gains in speed and storage efficiency. Two common approaches:

### A) PCA or SVD

1. **Collect** a representative sample (or all) of your 4096-d embeddings.
2. **Run** a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA or truncated SVD to get a transformation from 4096 → `D` (where `D`=512 or 768, etc.).
   - You can do this in Python with scikit-learn:
     ```python
     from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

     pca = PCA(n_components=768)
     pca.fit(embeddings_sample)  # embeddings_sample shape: (n_docs, 4096)

     # Then transform all future embeddings:
     reduced_emb = pca.transform(new_4096d_emb)  # => shape (n_docs, 768)
     ```
3. **Store** those lower-D vectors in your DB (e.g., `vector(768)`).
4. **Index** them with `ivfflat`. Build time, query time, and disk usage are all significantly less than 4096 dims.

**Pros**:

- Simple, well-known method, easily integrated into a pipeline.
- PCA is decently fast for mid-sized data if you have a GPU or big CPU.\
  **Cons**:
- Some retrieval performance may degrade, especially if you reduce dimension aggressively (like 4096 → 256).

### B) Autoencoder or Other Neural Dim-Reduction

1. **Train** a small autoencoder or a specialized dimension reduction model using your 4096-d embeddings as input.
2. **Encode** them down to 512 or 768 dimensions.
3. **Store** and index those reduced embeddings in pgvector.

**Pros**:

- Potentially more expressive than PCA if you have large data and can custom-train.\
  **Cons**:
- More complex. Harder to implement quickly. Gains may be modest vs. PCA unless you have a large dataset.

---

## 3. Hybrid Approach (Store & Index Both Full and Reduced)

If you’re not certain how much dimension reduction might harm retrieval accuracy, you can:

1. **Keep** the full 4096-d embeddings in your table (in `embedding_full`).
2. **Store** a reduced embedding (e.g. 768-d) in a separate column (e.g. `embedding_reduced`) to index and query.
3. **Compare** retrieval results. If you find the reduced dimension matches your use case well, continue using it. If you need extra fidelity for some queries or re-ranking, fall back to the 4096-d embeddings.

**Note**: This uses more storage, but you get the best of both worlds:

- quick approximate search on the smaller vectors,
- final re-ranking (if necessary) on the full 4096-d embeddings.

---

## 4. Performance Notes

1. **Index Size**:
   - A 4096-d index can be large. If you have tens of thousands or millions of rows, index building can require high `maintenance_work_mem`.
2. **Query Speed**:
   - Larger dimension → more data to do distance calculations on. You can tune `ivfflat.probes` or `lists` to trade off recall vs. speed.
3. **Offline vs. Online**:
   - If you do dimension reduction offline, you might run it in a batch job nightly or as part of a queue processing pipeline.
4. **Loss of Accuracy**:
   - Expect some drop in retrieval performance when going from 4096 → 512 or 768. How big the drop is depends on your domain and the rank threshold you care about.
   - Often you can retain 90%+ of the performance with around 512 to 768 dims, especially with a good PCA fit.

---

## 5. Implementation Outline

### A) Full Embedding Flow

1. **Generate** NV-Embed-v2 embeddings (4096-d) for each doc chunk:
   ```python
   embed_4096 = nv_embed_model.encode(texts, instruction=..., max_length=32768, ...)

   # shape: (batch_size, 4096)
   ```
2. **(Optional)** Reduce dimension (PCA or other):
   ```python
   reduced = pca.transform(embed_4096)  # shape (batch_size, 768)
   ```
3. **Store** either `embed_4096` or `reduced` in your DB column.
4. **Index** the chosen dimension with `ivfflat`.

### B) Script Modifications

- Add a step after `compute_batch_embeddings()` to apply PCA or autoencoder before returning the final vectors.
- Or write a separate offline job that queries rows with `embedding IS NULL`, compute the embeddings, do dimension reduction, then set `embedding`.

### C) Post-Index Tuning

- For `ivfflat`, tweak `WITH (lists = X)`.
- Increase `maintenance_work_mem` if needed.
- Possibly set `ivfflat.probes` in your session for more thorough search.

---

## 6. Conclusion

**Yes**, you can absolutely adopt `nvidia/NV-Embed-v2` to get best-in-class retrieval embeddings. But be aware of:

- **Dimension** = 4096 → big index and memory overhead,
- Potentially **slower** queries and index builds,
- Might need **dimension reduction** (via PCA/autoencoder) if that overhead is too high.

**In short**: Start with the full 4096-d if your hardware can handle it. If you face scaling or latency issues, do an offline PCA to reduce them down to 768 or so, preserving most of the retrieval benefit while drastically cutting down storage and compute usage.

Below is a step-by-step approach for **storing both the full-dimension NV-Embed-v2 embeddings** *and* **reduced-dimension embeddings** in Postgres, giving you maximum flexibility. You’ll have:

1. A **4096-d vector** column to preserve the highest-fidelity embedding for certain queries or re-ranking,
2. A **smaller** (e.g., 768-d or 384-d) column for everyday retrieval queries that require lower memory and faster performance.

This “**hybrid**” approach avoids re-embedding your documents if you decide to adjust dimension in the future and drastically speeds up average queries.

---

## 1. Database Schema Changes

Suppose your table is `crawl4ai_chunks`, which originally had one column `embedding vector(...)`. Now, you’ll define two columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crawl4ai_chunks
  ADD COLUMN embedding_full    vector(4096),
  ADD COLUMN embedding_reduced vector(768);
```

(Choose your reduced dimension—768 is often a good compromise, but 512 or even 256 might also work.)

**Note**: If you **already** have a single `embedding` column that’s dimension 384, you can rename it or remove it, and add the two new columns. Or keep `embedding` as is for smaller dimension, and add `embedding_full` for 4096-d. The naming is up to you.

---

## 2. Generating Embeddings in Your Pipeline

### A) Full-Dimensional Embedding

Use **NV-Embed-v2** (or any 4096-d model) to produce the maximum dimension. For instance (pseudocode):

```python
embedding_full_4096 = nv_embed_model.encode(
    texts, 
    instruction=..., 
    max_length=32768, 
    ...
)  # shape: [batch_size, 4096]
```

### B) Dimensionality Reduction

Apply a technique such as PCA or truncated SVD offline:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=768)
pca.fit(sample_of_full_4096)   # e.g., sample from your existing doc set

embedding_reduced_768 = pca.transform(embedding_full_4096)
# shape: [batch_size, 768]
```

**Important**: You typically do the `pca.fit(...)` step once, storing the PCA model object (or dumping it to disk). Then you do `pca.transform(...)` whenever you embed new data.

Alternatively, you might:

- Use an **autoencoder** or
- Another model-based approach for dimension reduction.

Either way, the result is a vector of size 768 (or your chosen dimension).

---

## 3. Storing Both Columns

Update your insertion logic so that **after** you generate the 4096-d embeddings, you do:

1. `embedding_full_4096` → store in `embedding_full`
2. `embedding_reduced_768` → store in `embedding_reduced`

In code (pseudocode):

```python
# Convert them to a pgvector string: "[1.23, 4.56, ...]"
full_vec_str = "[" + ",".join(f"{val}" for val in embedding_full_4096[i]) + "]"
red_vec_str  = "[" + ",".join(f"{val}" for val in embedding_reduced_768[i]) + "]"

# Then in your insert or update:
await conn.execute(
  """
  INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
    ( ..., embedding_full, embedding_reduced )
  VALUES
    ( ..., $1::vector, $2::vector )
  """,
  full_vec_str, red_vec_str
)
```

---

## 4. Indexing Each Column

You can maintain separate indexes:

```sql
-- Full dimension (ivfflat on 4096-d):
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_full
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding_full vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 128);

-- Reduced dimension (ivfflat on 768-d):
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_reduced
  ON crawl4ai_chunks
  USING ivfflat (embedding_reduced vector_l2_ops)
  WITH (lists = 1000);
```

**Why** different `lists`?

- The bigger dimension might require more memory/time to build an index. Possibly you keep it smaller.
- The 768-d might be your “main index” with more lists to maximize recall.

---

## 5. Everyday Querying

For typical retrieval (like a LLM agent needing quick doc chunks), you would do:

```sql
SET ivfflat.probes = 10;  -- or some tuned number
SELECT content,
       embedding_reduced <-> '[0.12, 0.88, ...]' AS distance
FROM crawl4ai_chunks
ORDER BY embedding_reduced <-> '[0.12, 0.88, ...]'
LIMIT 5;
```

This is **fast** due to the smaller dimension. If you find a subset of results that need more precise re-ranking, you can do a second pass on the **4096-d** column:

1. Take the top 20 or 50 results from the reduced embedding query,
2. Re-check distance with `embedding_full <-> '[0.12, 0.88, ...]'`,
3. Sort those 20–50 by that more accurate distance for a final ranking.

---

## 6. Managing Large Data Volume

Because you’re storing two embeddings per row, each chunk has **2** vector columns. If you have thousands or millions of chunks:

- **Disk usage**: More or less doubled for the embedding columns alone.
- **Index build time**: Each index is on a separate vector column. That means building or reindexing them can take time.
- **maintenance\_work\_mem**: Possibly raised if you see “memory required is X MB, maintenance\_work\_mem = Y MB”.

Often, you can keep your 4096-d column **unindexed** if you only plan to re-rank a small subset or do occasional advanced queries. Then the main day-to-day index is the reduced dimension. That approach can cut indexing overhead significantly.

---

## 7. Example Ingestion Flow

1. **Crawl** doc → produce text chunk → get full 4096-d from NV-Embed-v2 → run PCA → store 768-d.

2. **Insert** into DB with something like:

   ```python
   full_str = "[" + ",".join(str(x) for x in full_embed[i]) + "]"
   red_str  = "[" + ",".join(str(x) for x in red_embed[i]) + "]"

   await conn.execute(
       """
       INSERT INTO crawl4ai_chunks
         (content, embedding_full, embedding_reduced)
       VALUES ($1, $2::vector, $3::vector)
       """,
       chunk_content, full_str, red_str
   )
   ```

3. **Query** with the reduced embeddings for most lookups. If a user or agent wants extremely precise final ranking, fallback to `embedding_full`.

---

## 8. Testing & Evaluations

**Check** the difference between:

- **only using** 768-d retrieval,
- then re-ranking the top results with 4096-d.

You might find that 768 alone suffices for your use case. Or if you have demanding domain queries, the 4096 re-rank can make a difference.

---

## 9. Summary

1. **Define** two vector columns: `embedding_full (4096)` and `embedding_reduced (e.g. 768)`.
2. **Index** both or only the reduced column.
3. **Use** the reduced dimension for everyday queries (speed!), fallback to the full dimension for final re-ranking or advanced tasks.
4. **Profit** from both top-tier accuracy (with large dimension) and practical retrieval times (with smaller dimension).

This “**Hybrid approach**” ensures future adaptability—if you ever want 512-d, you can re-run your existing 4096-d embeddings through a new PCA, no re-embedding required from the LLM model.

Below is **one** possible way to incorporate the “hybrid approach”—storing both a **full 4096-d** embedding from `nvidia/NV-Embed-v2` and a **reduced** version (e.g., 768-d) in two separate columns. This example uses **PCA** for on-the-fly dimension reduction, but in practice you might prefer:

- **Offline** PCA fit once, then load the PCA model at runtime, or
- Another approach (e.g. an autoencoder),
- Or skip dimension reduction if you want only the full dimension.

## How This Script Works

1. **Model**: It loads `nvidia/NV-Embed-v2` (4096-d), with `trust_remote_code=True` so custom code in the model repo can run.
2. **PCA**: It attempts to load a pre-fitted PCA model (`pca_model_4096_to_768.pkl`). If missing, the script warns and sets `embedding_reduced` to zero vectors.
3. **DB**:
   - Grabs chunks from `crawl4ai_chunks` where `embedding_full` or `embedding_reduced` are `NULL`.
   - Embeds them in batches of 50.
   - Calls `compute_batch_embeddings()`, which returns **(full\_4096, reduced\_768)**.
   - Updates each row with two columns: `embedding_full` and `embedding_reduced`.
4. **Dim**: The columns must be declared as `vector(4096)` and `vector(768)` respectively in your `crawl4ai_chunks` table.
5. **Index**:
   - Typically, you only index `embedding_reduced` for day-to-day queries:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding_reduced
       ON crawl4ai_chunks
       USING ivfflat (embedding_reduced vector_l2_ops)
       WITH (lists = 1000);
     ```
   - You can skip indexing `embedding_full` (4096) or do so with fewer lists. Then, for advanced re-ranking, you can re-check “distance” on the full dimension in a smaller subset.

---

## Usage

1. **Train or Load** a PCA:
   - Fit PCA offline on a representative set of 4096-d embeddings, e.g.:
     ```python
     import pickle
     from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
     # Suppose embeddings_4096 is shape (N, 4096)
     pca = PCA(n_components=768)
     pca.fit(embeddings_4096)  
     with open("pca_model_4096_to_768.pkl","wb") as f:
         pickle.dump(pca, f)
     ```
2. **Run** your script:
   ```bash
   python vectorize_hybrid.py
   ```
3. **Watch** the logs and see the table’s columns get updated.

---

## Conclusion

This updated hybrid script preserves **both** the full-dimension vectors from NV-Embed-v2 for maximal fidelity and downsampled vectors for faster queries. You can do most retrievals on the smaller dimension while still having the original 4096-d available for advanced tasks or new reduction strategies in the future.

Below is an **updated hybrid vectorization script** that stores two columns:

- **`embedding_4096`** (`vector(4096)`): the high-fidelity embedding from **NV-Embed-v2**
- **`embedding_768`** (`vector(768)`): the dimension-reduced embedding (via PCA or another approach)

That way, the column names reflect their dimension directly. You only need to ensure your table schema uses these exact column names and dimensions.

## What Changed?

- **New column names**:
  - `embedding_4096`: The 4096-d embeddings from NV-Embed-v2.
  - `embedding_768`: The dimension-reduced embeddings.
- **SQL** references\*\*: The query checks `WHERE embedding_4096 IS NULL OR embedding_768 IS NULL`.
- **Update** statement sets both columns:
  ```sql
  UPDATE crawl4ai_chunks
     SET embedding_4096 = $1::vector,
         embedding_768  = $2::vector
   WHERE id = $3
  ```
- The PCA dimension is set to `REDUCED_DIM = 768`. Adjust as you like.
- If no PCA model is found, you see a warning, and `embedding_768` is filled with zero vectors, which means you can fix or re-run them later.

---

## Important Notes

1. **Schema**:
   - Make sure your table has 2 columns:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE crawl4ai_chunks
       ADD COLUMN embedding_4096 vector(4096),
       ADD COLUMN embedding_768  vector(768);
     ```
2. **Indexing**:
   - Usually you only create an index on `embedding_768` for day-to-day queries:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_768
       ON crawl4ai_chunks
       USING ivfflat (embedding_768 vector_l2_ops)
       WITH (lists = 1000);
     ```
   - You can skip or optionally index `embedding_4096` as well, but that might be large.
3. **Offline PCA**:
   - The script expects `pca_4096_to_768.pkl` in the same directory if you want actual reduced embeddings.
   - If you haven’t created it yet, do so offline:
     ```python
     # Example for an offline script
     import numpy as np
     import pickle
     from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

     # Suppose you have an array of shape [N, 4096] from previous embeddings
     all_embeddings = np.load("my_4096d_embeddings.npy")  # shape: (N, 4096)

     pca = PCA(n_components=768)
     pca.fit(all_embeddings)

     with open("pca_4096_to_768.pkl","wb") as f:
         pickle.dump(pca, f)

     print("Saved PCA model for 4096->768.")
     ```
4. **Memory**:
   - Building these 2 columns can double storage usage. Tweak `maintenance_work_mem` if you plan to index them.
5. **Agent usage**:
   - This script can be run at any time. If an agent ingests new data or modifies chunks, you run or re-run the script to fill in these two columns.

---

**That's it!** With these changes, you preserve the 4096-d embeddings for advanced tasks or future dimension reduction, while also having a daily driver 768-d embedding for quick approximate nearest neighbor queries.

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-23T05:22:11.105Z" title="1/23/2025, 2:22:11 PM">14:22</time>

Below are some **practical** ways to deal with the **CUDA Out of Memory** error when loading *nvidia/NV-Embed-v2* on a GPU with \~24GB (like an RTX 4090). This model is large—particularly if it’s storing multiple layers, buffer states, and a large hidden size for 4096-d outputs. Some strategies:

---

## 1. Try Environment Variable for Reduced Fragmentation

The error suggests:

> `... If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`

You can set this environment variable to potentially reduce fragmentation:

```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true
python your_script.py
```

Sometimes that alone might resolve the OOM.

---

## 2. Load Partially or with CPU/Offload

### A) Device = "cpu" at Load, then Move to GPU

Instead of `embedding_model.to(torch.device("cuda"))`, you can load the large model on CPU first, then partially or fully move its parameters to GPU. This can *sometimes* help if your GPU is tight on memory at model load time. For example:

```python
# Load on CPU
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(FULL_MODEL_NAME, trust_remote_code=True, device="cpu")
# Then do embedding on GPU when calling .encode():
embeddings = embedding_model.encode(texts, device="cuda")
```

**Caveat**: The library might still attempt to place submodules onto GPU at init, but this approach often helps if the code respects the `device=...` argument at load time.

### B) Accelerate / BitsAndBytes / Partial Offload

Advanced options:

- **Hugging Face Accelerate** can do partial GPU offload (some layers on GPU, some on CPU).
- **bitsandbytes** can do 8-bit or 4-bit quantization for large models.
- If your script is flexible, you can integrate these to drastically cut VRAM usage. For example:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig

  bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
  model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
      "nvidia/NV-Embed-v2",
      trust_remote_code=True,
      quantization_config=bnb_config
  )
  ```
  *But* you’d need to integrate that with `SentenceTransformer` carefully—some advanced steps might be required (like rewriting `_do_encode()`). So it’s not always plug-and-play.

---

## 3. Use Half Precision or Memory-Saving Options

If you can load the model in half precision (fp16) or bf16, you often reduce memory usage \~2x. Some steps:

1. **Check** if the model’s repo (nvidia/NV-Embed-v2) or code supports `revision="fp16"` or a safetensors version.
2. Or forcibly cast parameters to half:
   ```python
   embedding_model.half()
   ```
   after loading. This might conflict with certain modules unless they’re well-tested in half precision.

---

## 4. Use a Smaller Model

If these memory tweaks still fail, you could pick a smaller advanced embedding model. For instance:

- [**E5-Large**](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large), 1024-d, or
- [**Instructor-Large**](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large), 768-d

Both can approach high MTEB scores while being smaller than a 7B base. They typically load in \~8–16 GB VRAM.

---

## 5. Defer Downstream Steps until Data is Smaller

**One** side tactic: If your pipeline is purely doc ingestion, you might run the model in smaller micro-batches to avoid spiking memory. That’s partially what `batch_size=...` in `.encode()` does, but with an extremely large model it may not be enough. Partial offload is best.

---

## Summary of Approaches

1. **Environment variable**: `export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true`.
2. **Load with `device="cpu"`** and only move submodules to GPU at `.encode()`.
3. **Half precision** or **bitsandbytes** 8-bit or 4-bit quantization.
4. **Accelerate** for partial GPU offload.
5. **Use a smaller model** if you can’t reduce memory usage enough or prefer simpler usage.

**Conclusion**: For a large, instruction-tuned embedding model like *NV-Embed-v2*, you often need 32GB+ GPU memory or advanced memory-saving features to load it comfortably. By combining partial offload, half precision, or 8-bit quantization, you can usually get it working on a 24GB GPU like an RTX 4090. If that’s not feasible or is too complicated, a smaller model is a more straightforward solution.

How to avoid "CUDA out of memory" in PyTorch
Asked 5 years, 1 month ago
Modified 7 months ago

I think it's a pretty common message for PyTorch users with low GPU memory:

RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate X MiB (GPU X; X GiB total capacity; X GiB already allocated; X MiB free; X cached)

I tried to process an image by loading each layer to GPU and then loading it back:

for m in self.children():
    m.cuda()
    x = m(x)
    m.cpu()
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()

But it doesn't seem to be very effective. I'm wondering is there any tips and tricks to train large deep learning models while using little GPU memory.

    What's up with the smileys? lol.. Also, decrease your batch size and/or train on smaller images. Look at the Apex library for mixed precision training. Finally, when decreasing the batch size to, for example, 1 you might want to hold off on setting the gradients to zero after every iteration, since it's only based on a single image. –

    I had the same problem using Kaggle. It worked fine with batches of 64 and then once I tried 128 and got the error nothing worked. Even the batches of 64 gave me the same error. Tried resetting a few times. torch.cuda.empty_cache() did not work. Instead first disable the GPU, then restart the kernel, and reactivate the GPU. This worked for me. –

Although

import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

provides a good alternative for clearing the occupied cuda memory and we can also manually clear the not in use variables by using,

import gc
del variables
gc.collect()

But still after using these commands, the error might appear again because pytorch doesn't actually clears the memory instead clears the reference to the memory occupied by the variables. So reducing the batch_size after restarting the kernel and finding the optimum batch_size is the best possible option (but sometimes not a very feasible one).

Another way to get a deeper insight into the alloaction of memory in gpu is to use:

torch.cuda.memory_summary(device=None, abbreviated=False)

wherein, both the arguments are optional. This gives a readable summary of memory allocation and allows you to figure the reason of CUDA running out of memory and restart the kernel to avoid the error from happening again (Just like I did in my case).

Passing the data iteratively might help but changing the size of layers of your network or breaking them down would also prove effective (as sometimes the model also occupies a significant memory for example, while doing transfer learning).

    This gives a readable summary of memory allocation and allows you to figure the reason of CUDA running out of memory. I printed out the results of the torch.cuda.memory_summary() call, but there doesn't seem to be anything informative that would lead to a fix. I see rows for Allocated memory, Active memory, GPU reserved memory, etc. What should I be looking at, and how should I take action? –

Below are **some recommended approaches** to address “CUDA Out of Memory” issues when loading or running inference with a large model such as **nvidia/NV-Embed-v2** on a 24GB GPU (RTX 4090). These tips will help you free up memory, reduce usage, or avoid fragmentation that can cause OOM errors.

---

## 1. Restart Kernel / Clear GPU Memory Manually

- **Restart** the Python kernel or the process to fully clear GPU memory. Sometimes leftover memory from a previous run can remain allocated.
- **Use**:
  ```python
  import gc
  del some_variables
  gc.collect()
  torch.cuda.empty_cache()
  ```
  This doesn’t always fix the underlying issue but can help free references to objects in memory.

**Tip**: If you’re on a notebook environment (like Jupyter or Colab), sometimes a full kernel restart is the only fix.

---

## 2. Decrease Batch Size

If you’re actually encoding large amounts of data in *batches*:

1. **Lower** the `batch_size` parameter in `.encode(...)`.
2. **Iterate** over your dataset in smaller chunks, especially if you’re building embeddings for many texts.

**Even** during model loading, if the library tries to create large buffers, you may need partial offload or other advanced solutions below.

---

## 3. Expandable Segments to Avoid Fragmentation

As PyTorch’s error message says:

```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true
python your_script.py
```

- This can reduce memory fragmentation.
- If you see a large gap in “reserved vs. allocated” memory, this helps PyTorch manage GPU memory more flexibly.

---

## 4. Half Precision or BF16

If the model can support half-precision:

1. **Use** `model.half()` or `torch_dtype=torch.float16` at load time.
2. **Ensure** it actually does load in half precision. Some model code might not fully respect it.

**Caveat**: If the model wasn’t tested in half precision, it might produce suboptimal or unstable results.

---

## 5. 8-bit / 4-bit Quantization

Using **bitsandbytes** or other quantization approaches:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel
from accelerate import init_empty_weights
from bitsandbytes import BNBDot8Bit
# e.g. load with 8-bit weights
```

**This** can drastically reduce VRAM usage (2x to 4x smaller). However, you often need to do more custom integration if using `SentenceTransformer`.

---

## 6. CPU Loading + GPU Only for Inference

1. **Load** the model on CPU (e.g. `device="cpu"` or `trust_remote_code=True, device="cpu"`).
2. Then, **when** you call `.encode(...)`, pass `device="cuda"` if you have enough memory. This might avoid a large allocation spike at load time.

**Alternatively**, you can load the entire model on CPU, then carefully push only certain submodules to GPU. This requires partial offload code changes.

---

## 7. Use a Smaller Embedding Model

Even with “NV-Embed-v2,” you might find it too large. Good high-performance alternatives at smaller scale:

- **E5-large** (1–2GB VRAM usage),
- **Instructor-large** (\~2–3GB usage),
- Or an advanced, mid-sized embedding model like **all-mpnet-base-v2**.

**For MTEB** tasks, some smaller models (like E5-large or Instructor-large) can still achieve strong results while requiring far less memory.

---

## 8. Double-Check Overheads

Check if you’re also:

- **Importing** other large models in the same process,
- Running in a **GUI environment** or other GPU usage,
- Or your system is reserving GPU memory for X server processes, etc.

**Sometimes** you can free 1–2GB by closing certain GPU-accelerated apps or setting Linux to console mode rather than a graphical environment.

---

## 9. Summarize a Typical Workflow

**Example**:

```bash
# 1) Expandable segments
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true

# 2) Start from scratch
kill -9 <any leftover processes>

# 3) Possibly reduce batch_size=1 or 2 in your script

python run_compute.py
```

**If** that fails, try half precision or 8-bit quantization. If that fails, consider a smaller model or partial offload.

---

## Conclusion

**CUDA Out of Memory** on large, multi-billion-parameter embedding models is common with a 24GB GPU—especially if the model is loaded fully in float32 or in an environment with fragmentation. Combining any of these solutions—**expandable\_segments**, **lower batch size**, **half precision / bitsandbytes** 8-bit, or **partial CPU offload**—usually resolves OOM issues. If not, you might simply pick a more memory-friendly model.

To find and kill leftover processes that might be occupying your GPU memory:

1. **List GPU usage**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     nvidia-smi
     ```
     This will list all processes using the GPU, along with their process IDs (PIDs), memory usage, etc. Look for processes labeled “python,” “python3,” “python.exe,” or anything suspicious that might be leftover from your previous runs.

2. **Locate the PID**:
   - In the `nvidia-smi` output, under the “Processes” section, you’ll see lines showing something like:
     ```
     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     | Processes:                                                                  |
     |  GPU   PID   Type   Process name                    GPU Memory             |
     |  0     2796  C+G    /usr/bin/python                 22075MiB               |
     ...
     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     ```
     The **PID** is the second column (e.g., 2796 in the above example).

3. **Kill the leftover process**:
   - Once you have the PID (say `2796`), you can stop it by:
     ```bash
     kill -9 2796
     ```
     That immediately kills that process and frees GPU memory.

4. **Alternatively**, you can also search running processes by using standard UNIX tools:
   - `ps aux | grep python`
   - `htop` or `top` to see CPU processes, though that won’t show the GPU usage, so `nvidia-smi` is usually more direct for GPU memory identification.

**Important**: If you’re using a notebook environment (like Jupyter), you may see a kernel process that’s hogging GPU memory. In that case, it’s often simplest to **restart the kernel** or the notebook server, which forcibly kills the Python process.

---

### Steps Summary

1. **`nvidia-smi`** → see which processes are on the GPU.
2. **Find** the PID → e.g., 2796.
3. **Kill** by `kill -9 2796` if that process is no longer needed.
4. **Check again** with `nvidia-smi` to confirm GPU memory is freed.

From the **nvidia-smi** output, you can see:

```
Processes:
 GPU   PID   Type   Process name          GPU Memory
 ...
 0     2796  C      /usr/bin/hqplayer5desktop   392MiB
```

This indicates that the **`hqplayer5desktop`** process (PID **2796**) is occupying **392 MiB** of your GPU memory. If you don’t need that process (and it won’t disrupt anything else you’re running), you can kill it using:

```bash
kill -9 2796
```

**Important**: This immediately stops the process and may terminate any functionality it’s providing. If you’re using HQPlayer for something else, consider gracefully quitting it if possible before forcibly killing. After you do so, re-check memory usage via `nvidia-smi` to confirm the GPU memory is freed.

OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 224.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.54 GiB of which 220.75 MiB is free

there is clearly a lot of space available. why does it say there is no more space?


#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-23T05:37:33.271Z" title="1/23/2025, 2:37:33 PM">14:37</time>

When PyTorch says “GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.54 GiB of which 220.75 MiB is free,” yet it still reports *Out of memory*, that usually indicates **memory fragmentation** or **reserved memory** constraints, **not** simply that the raw memory total is near zero:

1. **PyTorch pre-allocates** or “reserves” large GPU blocks. Once allocated, PyTorch doesn’t instantly release them back to the system, but instead marks them internally as “allocated” or “reserved.” A chunk of memory might be “reserved” but not actively in use. However, it can’t always be simply re-used if the block is not contiguous or if the memory manager is fragmented.

2. The error specifically says, *“If reserved but unallocated memory is large, try setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true` to avoid fragmentation.”* In your case, there is probably a big chunk pinned by earlier allocations, so there isn’t a contiguous 224 MiB block for the next layer or buffer.

3. **nvidia-smi** doesn’t display fragmentation; it just shows total memory and usage. PyTorch may not be able to carve out a single 224 MiB chunk from what remains, because the memory is in small fragments or pinned.

4. Other GPU processes (like Xorg, a desktop environment, or any leftover python process) may be using small amounts of VRAM, also leading to fragmentation.

---

### How to fix

- **Restart** the Python program or the environment (Kernel) to clear GPU memory from previous runs.
- **Expand** memory segments to reduce fragmentation:
  ```bash
  export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true
  python your_script.py
  ```
- **Reduce** your model usage:
  - Use half precision or 8-bit quantization,
  - Move layers to CPU,
  - or use a smaller model.
- **Kill** any leftover GPU processes (`nvidia-smi` → `kill -9 <pid>`) if they are not needed.
- If in a notebook environment, do a full kernel restart to free up all VRAM.

Ultimately, “GPU has a total capacity of 23.54 GiB, 220.75 MiB free” means that *the block of contiguous memory* needed for that next allocation isn’t available in one piece. Even though you see “only 392 MiB” in use by another process, large internal buffers (or fragmentation) can block a chunk of memory.

The error **“Unrecognized CachingAllocator option: expandable\_segments=True”** indicates that your installed version of PyTorch doesn't recognize the `expandable_segments:true` option. This environment variable was added in **PyTorch 2.3**. If you're running an older PyTorch version, it will fail to parse that setting and throw this error.

---

## How to Fix

1. **Check Your PyTorch Version**
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
   ```
   If it’s older than 2.3 (e.g. 2.2.0, 2.1, 1.13, etc.), you need to upgrade or remove the environment variable.

2. **Upgrade to PyTorch 2.3+**
   - For Conda:
     ```bash
     conda install pytorch==2.3.0 cudatoolkit=XX.X -c pytorch
     ```
     *(Adjust `cudatoolkit` to match your environment, e.g., `12.1`.)*
   - For Pip:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade torch==2.3.* torchvision==0.15.* torchaudio==2.3.* -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
     ```
   - Or whichever channel matches your CUDA version.

3. **Remove** or **Comment Out** the environment variable if you cannot upgrade:
   ```bash
   unset PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
   python your_script.py
   ```
   Then PyTorch will not attempt to parse `expandable_segments:true`.

4. **Confirm** that “expandable\_segments” is recognized:
   - After upgrading, re-run with:
     ```bash
     export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:true
     python your_script.py
     ```

---

### Summary

- **expandable\_segments** is only valid in PyTorch 2.3.0 or higher.
- If you have an older version, either **upgrade** or **remove** that environment variable. Once you have PyTorch >=2.3, you can use `expandable_segments:true` to reduce memory fragmentation.

That **LibMambaUnsatisfiableError** means Conda’s solver can’t find a matching set of packages to satisfy your requests for *pytorch*, *cudatoolkit*, and *CUDA 12.1 libraries* all at once. This often happens if the environment already has packages that pin conflicting CUDA versions, or if certain channels or versions are unavailable.

Below are a few **common workarounds**:

---

## 1. Create a Fresh Environment with PyTorch 2.3 + CUDA 12.x

Sometimes it’s easier to start fresh rather than to upgrade in-place. For example, do:

```bash
conda create -n ptorch23 python=3.10 -y
conda activate ptorch23

# Now install PyTorch 2.3.* with CUDA 12.1
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Key points:

- **`-c pytorch -c nvidia`** ensures you get PyTorch and CUDA libraries from their official channels.
- **`pytorch-cuda=12.1`** helps unify the versions for 12.1. If you’re on a system with driver 565.57.01 (which supports up to 12.7), you can sometimes do `pytorch-cuda=12.7` if it exists.
- If `conda` still cannot solve it, try **Mamba**, a drop-in replacement solver with better conflict resolution:

  ```bash
  conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
  mamba create -n ptorch23 python=3.10
  mamba activate ptorch23
  mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
  ```

---

## 2. Use Pip instead of Conda

If conda channels are giving you trouble, you can still keep a conda environment for Python but install PyTorch via pip wheels:

```bash
conda create -n ptorch23 python=3.10
conda activate ptorch23

# Manually install the matching wheel from PyTorch's official instructions:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

That will install the PyTorch wheels compiled for CUDA 12.1. Then `conda install` can be used for everything else except PyTorch.

**Check** your GPU driver is new enough for 12.1. (Your version `565.57.01` should handle up to CUDA 12.7, so that’s fine.)

---

## 3. Remove / Downgrade Conflicting Packages

If your environment has packages that force older CUDA or older PyTorch, you could do:

```bash
conda remove --force pytorch cudatoolkit
conda install pytorch-cuda=12.1 pytorch=2.3 torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

But sometimes that leads to breakage. A new environment is safer.

---

## 4. Confirm Which CUDA Versions are Actually Available

- **Conda** channels might not have a `pytorch-cuda=12.7` build for your OS yet. Or it might only have 12.1 or 11.8.
- If your system driver can handle up to 12.7, that doesn’t guarantee conda has a matching PyTorch build for 12.7 yet.
- You can check with:

  ```bash
  conda search pytorch-cuda -c nvidia
  conda search pytorch -c pytorch
  ```

  This shows which builds exist. You can pick a known matching pair (e.g., `pytorch-cuda=12.1` + `pytorch=2.3.*`).

---

## 5. Variation: `cudatoolkit` vs. `pytorch-cuda`

- Historically, you did `conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.8 -c pytorch`, etc.
- **New** approach is `pytorch-cuda=XX.X`, which is an all-in-one package ensuring your local environment has a matching CUDA runtime. This must be consistent with the system driver.
- If your environment or an older conda environment references `cudatoolkit=10.x` or something, conflict arises.

---

## Summary

To fix the “requires cuda-libraries >=12.1,<12.2 but none of the providers can be installed” error:

1. **Start fresh** with a new environment and specify `pytorch-cuda=12.1`.
2. **Use** `-c pytorch -c nvidia` channels to ensure availability.
3. If conda refuses to solve, use **mamba** or **pip**.
4. Check your GPU driver is new enough to run that version (which it is, since you have driver 565.57.01).

This is generally the easiest path to get PyTorch 2.3 working with a modern CUDA 12 environment.

[Warning] No PCA model found, embedding_768 will be zero vectors!

<time datetime="2025-01-23T06:00:37.809Z" title="1/23/2025, 3:00:37 PM">15:00</time>

When you see a log message like:

```
[Warning] No PCA model found, embedding_768 will be zero vectors!
```

it typically means your pipeline is **attempting** to produce a lower-dimensional embedding (for example, 768‑dim) but **cannot** find a trained PCA (or any dimensionality-reduction) model to do so. As a result, the script (or code) is falling back to zeros for `embedding_768`.

Below is a quick overview of **why** that warning appears and **how** to fix it, so that you can actually store a meaningful down-sampled vector.

---

## 1. Why This Happens

1. You have a large embedding model (e.g., 4,096‑dim outputs).
2. You want to store a down-sampled “lighter” version (e.g., 768‑dim) for everyday retrieval or smaller indexes.
3. The pipeline tries to do a **PCA** (or another dimensionality-reduction technique) to get from 4,096 → 768.
4. The script can’t find the actual PCA transform file (e.g., a `.pkl` or `.joblib`) and thus logs a warning like:
   ```
   No PCA model found, embedding_768 will be zero vectors!
   ```
   So it’s just stuffing zeros in your 768 column as a placeholder.

---

## 2. Setting Up a PCA (or Another Method)

### A) Train a PCA Model

1. Collect a sample set of 4,096‑dim vectors from your actual data (maybe 50k–100k rows).
2. Use scikit-learn or similar:
   ```python
   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
   import numpy as np

   # Suppose embeddings_4096 is an N x 4096 NumPy array
   pca_768 = PCA(n_components=768)
   pca_768.fit(embeddings_4096)  # This might take a while, but only once

   # save it
   import joblib
   joblib.dump(pca_768, "pca_768.model")
   ```

### B) Load & Apply the PCA

In your actual pipeline (like the code for updating your database columns), do something like:

```python
pca_768 = joblib.load("pca_768.model")

def reduce_dim_768(embedding_4096: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    arr_4096 = np.array(embedding_4096).reshape(1, -1)  # shape (1, 4096)
    reduced_arr = pca_768.transform(arr_4096)  # shape (1, 768)
    return reduced_arr[0].tolist()
```

**Then** store that resulting vector in your `embedding_768` column, for example.

---

## 3. Updating Your Script

Wherever your code tries to do:

```python
if not pca_model_found:
    logger.warning("No PCA model found, embedding_768 will be zero vectors!")
    # ...
```

You can replace that logic by **loading** the PCA file and applying it.

If you truly want a fallback, you can keep the zero-vector approach or skip the downsample step. But obviously, you lose the advantage of a smaller embedding.

---

## 4. Why 768 Dimensions?

- Many common text embedding models produce \~768 dims (like BERT-based).
- Storing 4096 might be more accurate but is heavier for retrieval.
- PCA to 768 is a **compromise** that might preserve most semantic info while drastically reducing disk usage and index size.

---

## 5. Summary

**To fix** `[Warning] No PCA model found, embedding_768 will be zero vectors!`, you must:

1. **Train** a PCA (or alternative) on a batch of 4,096-d embeddings.
2. **Save** and load that model in your pipeline code.
3. **Transform** new 4,096-d embeddings to 768-d before storing them.

Once you do that, your `embedding_768` column will contain real numeric data rather than zeros, letting you build or query a smaller vector index for everyday retrieval.

is it possible to downsample without training on my own data?

In general, **downsampling** from a high-dimensional embedding (e.g. 4096 → 768) requires some form of transform (like PCA, SVD, a projection layer, etc.) that reduces dimensionality but preserves as much semantic information as possible. Usually, you train that transform on real data to learn how best to compress your embeddings.

However, if you **don’t** want to train on your own data, there are a few alternatives:

---

## 1. Use a **Random Projection** (RP)

You can map from 4096 dimensions to 768 dimensions (or any desired size) with a random matrix. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)
random_matrix = rng.normal(size=(4096, 768))

def random_projection_768(vec_4096: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # shape (4096,) -> shape (768,)
    return vec_4096 @ random_matrix
```

### Pros

- No data needed.
- Very simple to implement.

### Cons

- Doesn’t usually preserve as much semantic structure as PCA or any learned transform.
- You might need to do post-processing (e.g., re‑normalize the final vector).

This approach can still work decently for large embeddings, given that random projections can preserve pairwise distances (per the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma), though not as effectively as a well-trained PCA or autoencoder.

---

## 2. A **Generic** Pre-Trained Reduction Layer

Sometimes the model authors provide an optional “bottleneck” layer or a 2-stage approach that produces, for example, 768-d from an internal representation. But this is only available if:

1. The model was released with an explicit “reduction” or “projection” submodule.
2. There’s a community-provided `.pt` or `.pkl` with a transform for that model.

If **nvidia/NV-Embed-v2** (or any large embedding model) doesn’t provide a built-in 768 option or a partial checkpoint, you can’t use that method out of the box.

---

## 3. Re-Use **Someone Else’s PCA** from Another Domain

Potentially, you could find a pre-trained PCA for a large text corpus (like the entire C4 dataset) that maps 4096 → 768. But:

- The results might not be ideal for your domain.
- In practice, there’s no standard or universal “PCA on all text embeddings” that is guaranteed to help.

So this is rarely done in practice.

---

## 4. Accept Zero-Vectors (Not Recommended)

If you simply set `embedding_768` to zero vectors because you don’t have a trained transform, that’s basically losing all semantic info for that column. It defeats the purpose of storing an embedding.

---

### Summary

**Yes**, you can do dimension reduction without specifically training on your own data, but **most approaches** will either rely on:

1. **Random projection** (simple, no data needed, but less accurate).
2. **Pre-existing** universal transforms (rarely provided).

If you want to get the best possible semantic compression for your domain, you typically run PCA (or another method) on real embeddings from *your* text corpus. That ensures the reduction is tuned to your distribution, preserving the *most relevant* variance in fewer dimensions.

how is downsampling to 768 from 4096 different than producing an extraction natively at 768

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-24T02:48:56.243Z" title="1/24/2025, 11:48:56 AM">11:48</time>

When you **downsample** from a high-dimensional embedding (e.g., 4096) to a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 768) *after* the model has already produced a 4096‑dim vector, it differs from a model that *natively* outputs 768‑dim embeddings in several ways:

---

## 1. Where Dimensionality Is Determined

- **Native 768**: The model’s architecture (final layer or pooling) is inherently designed to yield a 768‑dim representation. The entire forward pass is shaped around producing that smaller output.
- **Downsampling 4096 → 768**: The model first computes a 4096‑dim vector internally, then you apply an external transform (like PCA) or random projection to compress it to 768. The embedding model itself has no knowledge that it’ll be compressed.

---

## 2. Training & Representation Quality

- **Native 768**: The model’s final layers are typically trained end-to-end to produce 768‑dim embeddings. The training objective (e.g. contrastive loss or multiple tasks) is aligned with 768 as the target dimension. That can lead to an embedding space that’s *naturally* 768‑dim.
- **Downsampled 4096**: The base model is designed for 4096 dimensions. By applying PCA or another method afterwards, you’re compressing an already learned 4096‑dim space. Some information might be lost in the compression. However, you can also argue that a 4096-d internal space might hold more nuance, which you can partially preserve with a carefully trained PCA or advanced technique.

---

## 3. Resource & Performance Impact

- **Native 768**:
  - **Less VRAM** usage in inference (the model’s final embedding-layers are sized for 768 dims).
  - Typically **faster** to produce a 768 vector if all final layers lead directly to 768.
  - The model is smaller to store and to load into memory.

- **Downsample 4096 → 768**:
  - The model still has large final layers that produce 4096 dims, requiring more compute and memory usage up front.
  - After generating 4096, you apply a second step to compress it. That can be a matrix multiply or PCA transform, which adds more overhead.
  - The advantage is that you have the full 4096 for “special-case” tasks, but a 768 version for everyday retrieval.

---

## 4. Flexibility vs. Direct Design

- **Native 768**: You’re locked into that dimension for all tasks. It’s typically well-optimized for that dimension.
- **Downsample**:
  1. You can store both the “full” (4096-d) and the “reduced” embedding side-by-side in your database.
  2. Over time, you might pick a different dimension (like 384 or 1024) if you want a different trade-off. You can re-run PCA training or another compression method without having to re-run the entire LLM embedding pipeline.

---

## 5. Accuracy vs. Customization

- **Native**: The model architecture is *specifically* validated at 768, so you get a single well-calibrated representation.
- **Downsample**:
  - You can “tune” the compression to your own domain by training PCA on domain-specific embedding samples—leading to a potentially more domain-focused subspace.
  - If you do a generic random projection or an un-optimized PCA, you might degrade retrieval performance more than a model that was natively at 768.

---

### Summary

- A model *natively* outputting 768 dims is simpler, more memory-efficient, and *internally* trained to produce exactly that embedding size.
- A model producing **4096** dims, then **downsampling** to 768, can store a *full*, high-dimensional representation for specialized usage while also generating smaller vectors for everyday retrieval. However, it requires an **extra** transform step (PCA or random projection) and typically uses more memory/time during inference.

Which approach is best depends on **resource constraints**, **domain** requirements, and whether you need a single universal embedding dimension or want the **flexibility** to maintain a large “master” embedding from which you can derive various compressed versions.

Below is a **revised “compute embeddings” script** that **does not** do any dimension reduction. It fetches a single column name from a config file (e.g., `embedding_column`), as well as the model name (e.g., `embedding_model`), and uses them to load a model and store embeddings to that one column. It also loads optional Ollama parameters from the same config—though you may not need them in this particular script if it only does embeddings. The idea is to illustrate how all these options could be loaded from a single YAML or JSON config.

Below is **one** approach; adapt it as needed.

### Explanation

1. **Configuration**
   - We load `embedding_model` & `embedding_column` from a YAML file, e.g. `embedding_config.yml`.
   - If you want to store all the Ollama options, you can put them into `ollama_options` in the same config. (They’re not actually used in this script, but you can pass them to another function if needed.)

2. **Single Embedding Column**
   - This script does *not* do dimension reduction. We simply produce an embedding and store it in one column.
   - The name of that column is in the config, e.g. `embedding_column: "embedding_4096"` or just `"embedding"`.

3. **No Overlapping**
   - If you do want multiple columns (like `embedding_4096` and `embedding_768`), you can easily replicate the logic with two columns. This version only uses one.

4. **Catching Missing Rows**
   - We do `WHERE embedding_... IS NULL`. If you want to re-embed everything, you can skip the `WHERE ... IS NULL`.

5. **Asynchronous**
   - We rely on `asyncio` and `asyncpg` to do concurrency for DB updates.
   - The script loops until there are no more un-embedded rows.

6. **Memory**
   - If you run into GPU memory issues for big LLM embeddings (like 4,096 or more), you can reduce batch size or use half precision.

### Sample `embedding_config.yml`

```yaml
embedding_model: "nvidia/NV-Embed-v2"
embedding_column: "embedding_4096"

ollama_options:
  temperature: 0.7
  repeat_penalty: 1.2
  # etc.
```

This way, your script can easily swap in different models or columns just by editing the config, rather than modifying code.
