Yes, ANA (All Nippon Airways) typically allows you to cancel a flight within 24 hours of booking for a full refund, as long as the flight is booked at least 7 days before the departure date. This policy applies to both domestic and international flights, but be sure to review any specific terms and conditions related to your ticket type. Some fare classes may have different rules.

If you're within that window, you can contact ANA directly or use their online services to cancel the flight. It's always a good idea to check their official website or contact their customer service for the most up-to-date information.

Are you planning to make any changes to your travel plans for your Japan trip?

Fare Rules for Domestic Routes

This page explains the fare rules for domestic routes.

    1. Domestic route fare rules
    2. Fares depending on seat availability 

1. Domestic route fare rules

For fares and fees for domestic routes, if there is a fare change after the flight tickets are purchased, the fare valid on the day the flight tickets were purchased will be applied.

 

Even if the fare is changed after the flight ticket has been purchased, no additional charges or refunds will be made for the difference.
What is the "fare valid on the day the flight tickets were purchased"?

Example: Flight tickets purchased on April 20 for JPY 15,000 for departure on June 20

The fare basis date is the standard ANA uses to determine ticket fares.

2. Fares depending on seat availability

"ANA FLEX"

    The lowest fare available from types A to D will apply depending on the estimated number of seats available on the relevant flight.

    Depending on the estimated number of seats available, a fare difference (between types A-D) may be incurred upon changing your reservation.
"ANA VALUE PREMIUM 3"

    Either the ANA VALUE PREMIUM 3A or ANA VALUE PREMIUM 3B will be applied depending on the estimated number of seats available on the relevant flight.
"ANA SUPER VALUE", "ANA VALUE"

    Based on the expected seat availability for each flight and the reservation date, the lowest ANA SUPER VALUE and ANA VALUE that can be reserved/purchased will be displayed respectively (out of ANA SUPER VALUE 75, 55, 45, 28, 21 and ANA VALUE 1, 3, 7).

    From the fares selected, the lowest fare setting (from type A to N) will be applied in accordance with the expected number of seats available.

    *

    As the expected seat availability varies on a daily basis, the fares available for purchase may differ depending on when the reservation is made.

It looks like you've found the section on ANA's fare rules for domestic routes. Based on the information available there, for domestic flights, ANA does have different fare structures depending on availability and ticket type, such as **ANA FLEX**, **ANA SUPER VALUE**, and **ANA VALUE** fares. However, for cancellations, it doesn't mention the 24-hour rule specifically, which generally applies to **international flights** or tickets bought directly from ANA's website.

If you're referring to a **domestic flight** in Japan, cancellation policies might depend on the type of fare purchased. It’s common for low-cost tickets like **ANA SUPER VALUE** and **ANA VALUE** to have more restrictions or require a fee for changes or cancellations.

I recommend checking your specific ticket type on ANA's website or contacting their customer service to get precise details on cancellation policies for your case. Would you like any more help with this?
