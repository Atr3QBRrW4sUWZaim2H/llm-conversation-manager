i;m trying to debug an issue with my apple in app purchase in my ios app.  it typically takes more than 10 seconds to get notified from Apple about a subscription purchase from when the person starts a purchase. in that time i have to wait for the message from apple. 10 seconds is a long wait -- i don't see that on other apps. what should i investigate?

A flow from subscription purchase to premium feature activation is the following.
A user purchases a subscription on App.
Apple sends us a notification to let us know a user purchased a subscription.
We, handle the notification. We update user subscriptions based on the notification.
First, we store the notification and update a subscription.
Respond to Apple’s App Store Server.
Finally, we update the subscription status on profile in a post process. The App fetches a subscription status our internal database.

Median and 95 percentile for each steps are:
From purchase (1) to responding App Store Server (3.b): 12000[msec], 27000[msec] (IQL)
Note: (3.a) to (3b)’s median and 95 percentil: 363[msec], 363[msec] (datadog, server side)
Updating subscription status on profile (3.c): 156.8[msec], 240[msec] (onegraph insights, server side)
Fetching subscription status:  45.4[msec], 130[msec] (onegraph insights, server side)

Those show that the high latency from subscription purchase to premium feature activation is because of the delay in Apple’s App Store Server.

**Summary of the Problem**

You’re seeing a significant delay (median \~12 s, and 95th percentile \~27 s) between the time a user *starts* a subscription purchase and the time your server *gets* Apple’s notification, which triggers your internal “subscription activated” logic. Meanwhile, your own server‑side steps (storing the notification, updating the user’s subscription, responding to Apple, updating the DB, etc.) are quite fast—just a few hundred milliseconds. Thus, nearly all of the 10+ second latency is on the Apple side. You’re wondering why other apps don’t seem to wait that long (or at least the user doesn’t notice it) and what you can investigate or do differently.

## 1. Apple’s Notification Timing vs. Local Transaction Updates

**The key point** is that Apple does *not* guarantee that App Store Server Notifications are real‑time. Notifications can often come fairly quickly, but they can also take many seconds, or even minutes in certain edge cases. Many developers observe that local receipt verification or a local `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` can detect new purchases more quickly on‑device than waiting for Apple’s server to call back your backend.

### Local Transaction Observer Flow

When a user purchases a subscription *in the iOS app*:

1. The user’s device (StoreKit) completes or fails the transaction.
2. Your iOS code (via `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` or StoreKit 2’s modern APIs) gets immediate callbacks that the purchase was successful.
3. You can enable premium features *right then* (optimistically), or do an immediate local receipt validation call to confirm that the new subscription is valid.
4. In the background, Apple eventually sends an App Store Server Notification to your backend.
5. Your backend updates its own database to reflect the official subscription status—this can handle renewals, cancellations, refunds, and so forth.

Using that approach, the user experience is that the app “unlocks” very quickly—often sub‑1 second—and you still have a server‑side record that’s updated as soon as Apple’s server notification arrives.

**Many apps handle subscription activation this way** because it shields the user from Apple’s latency. The local device can show “You’re now Premium!” while the server is updated asynchronously. If the local validation or receipt fetch fails for some reason, you can still request the subscription status from your backend as a fallback.

---

## 2. What to Investigate Specifically

1. **Are you relying *solely* on App Store Server Notifications for activation?**
   - If so, you’ll often see unpredictable delay. Apple’s official documentation itself states that notifications are not guaranteed to be in real-time. Investigate switching to (or supplementing with) local transaction observation so that the app can unlock immediately.

2. **Are you verifying the purchase receipt in your server *before* giving the user access?**
   - If you wait for “Server Notification → verify → mark user active → notify app,” you must accept Apple’s network or processing delays. Check if you can at least do an immediate local validation or partial unlock in the app while you wait for the server confirmation.

3. **Check your production vs. sandbox environment**
   - Sandbox can behave differently (sometimes slower, ironically sometimes faster) than production. Confirm that you’re not seeing extended times in sandbox only, and that production has similar or dissimilar timing.
   - In some cases, sandbox notifications can be more erratic in timing compared to production.

4. **Server or network issues on your end**
   - Although your server time from (3.a) to (3.b) is quick (\~363 ms median), still confirm there’s no firewall or misconfiguration that could cause Apple to retry or hold the notification. Sometimes if Apple times out on the initial attempt or sees a 5xx error, it retries later, adding delay. Check your server logs to ensure you return a `200 OK` quickly and consistently.

5. **Check that you’re not missing the immediate “Transaction” on the device**
   - It’s possible your iOS client is not properly observing transactions. If you never finish transactions locally, that can lead to weird states or delayed callbacks. Make sure you use `SKPaymentQueue.finishTransaction(_:)` (StoreKit 1) or the proper finalize call in StoreKit 2.

6. **Use the latest StoreKit 2 enhancements** (if you can)
   - Apple has introduced new APIs in iOS 15+ with StoreKit 2. They claim to simplify subscription logic, give you direct `TransactionListener` to new transactions, handle renewals, etc. You might still want server notifications for redundant or “trusted” logging, but the user unlock can happen the moment the device sees the transaction.

7. **Accept that some fraction of transactions *will* take time**
   - Even if everything is configured correctly, some fraction of transactions can take 10 seconds or more for the user. But typically, the user sees a “Purchased!” message from StoreKit or sees that the app’s premium features have unlocked. They don’t notice or care that your server’s official record might not be updated until Apple’s notification arrives a few seconds later.

---

## 3. Best Practices to Reduce User‑Visible Delays

- **Give immediate access in the app once StoreKit says “purchased.”**
  - This is the single most common approach. Rely on App Store Server Notifications primarily for subscription lifecycle events (renewals, cancellations, billing issues).

- **Perform quick local validation if you need extra security.**
  - Even if you do local validation, that’s typically faster than waiting for the server. The user doesn’t have to wait for Apple to notify your backend.

- **Asynchronously update your backend** with final subscription data from the receipt or from Apple’s notification.
  - That ensures your server remains the source of truth without blocking the user’s immediate experience.

- **Show a subtle “verifying” state in the UI** if needed, but don’t block the main content.
  - If local validation is uncertain or fails, you can gracefully prompt the user to “Restore Purchase” or sign out / in again, or let them know that verification is taking longer than usual.

- **Consider Apple’s “Transaction Manager” or StoreKit Testing** (StoreKit 2) to replicate real purchase flows in sandbox and Xcode.

---

## 4. Conclusion

The major investigation point is that you’re currently *depending* on Apple’s App Store Server Notification to mark the subscription as active—and that channel is inherently asynchronous and sometimes delayed. Other apps appear faster to users because they typically unlock immediately on the device (either optimistically or via local receipt validation).

To get rid of that 10-second visible wait:

- **Implement the standard approach**: Use `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` (StoreKit 1) or the StoreKit 2 `TransactionListener` to detect purchases in real time, give the user premium access, and then let your server catch up via the notification a few seconds later.
- Double-check your server logs and response codes to ensure no issues on your side.
- Don’t rely exclusively on “Server Notification → DB update → app sees new status” for that first unlocking step.

That’s the fundamental shift that allows apps to feel *instant* even if Apple’s server notifications take a while to come in.

**Short Answer**\
Yes, in almost all cases, your iOS code receives a callback (via `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` or StoreKit 2) *immediately after* the user completes the purchase flow on their device. There can be edge cases where the callback is delayed or occurs the next time the app is launched (e.g. if the app was backgrounded at just the wrong time), but under normal circumstances, StoreKit notifies your app as soon as the user confirms the purchase in the App Store sheet.

---

## 1. Where This “Immediate” Callback Comes From

- **StoreKit 1 (`SKPaymentTransactionObserver`)**
  - After calling `SKPaymentQueue.default().add(self)` to set your observer, StoreKit will call your `paymentQueue(_:updatedTransactions:)` method almost right away when:
    1. The transaction is purchased,
    2. The transaction fails,
    3. The transaction is restored, or
    4. The transaction is in a deferred state.
  - The user typically sees an App Store sheet to confirm the purchase. Once they finalize it, StoreKit sends the updated transaction to your observer.

- **StoreKit 2 (`TransactionListener`)**
  - In iOS 15+, the `Transaction.updates` AsyncSequence (or the `StoreKit.TransactionListener` approach) detects changes to the current user’s transaction state directly on the device.
  - Similarly, as soon as the purchase completes, StoreKit 2 attempts to deliver the new transaction to your app (assuming the app is still running and able to receive updates).

In both systems, the typical time from user tapping “Buy” → iOS popup for payment → user confirms → your app’s observer receives the transaction is on the order of *a second or two*, not tens of seconds.

---

## 2. Potential Edge Cases and Delays

1. **Network or Device Issues**
   - If the user’s device has a poor network connection or disconnects mid-purchase, the callback might be delayed until the device can reconnect to Apple’s servers.

2. **Deferred Purchases (Ask to Buy)**
   - If *Ask to Buy* is enabled (e.g., for child accounts), the parent’s approval can delay the transaction until they confirm it on their device. You might see the transaction in a “deferred” state in the observer callback.

3. **App Went to Background**
   - If the app is backgrounded or terminated during the final purchase step, StoreKit can deliver the callback the next time the app launches or foregrounds.

4. **Pending Automatic Renewals**
   - For subscription renewals, you won’t get an *immediate* local callback because these are processed by Apple’s servers automatically (in the background). You *do* get updates eventually in `SKPaymentTransactionObserver`, but it can be sporadic. That’s where App Store Server Notifications can be more reliable for renewals.

Despite these, for an *initial* in-app purchase that the user actively initiates in the app UI, StoreKit typically calls you very quickly once the purchase is confirmed.

---

## 3. Comparing to App Store Server Notifications

- The local device callback typically arrives within a second or two of purchase completion.
- Apple’s **App Store Server Notifications** can sometimes arrive within seconds, but can also take tens of seconds or, in rare circumstances, even minutes. They’re designed for backend synchronization and do not guarantee real-time delivery.

**That’s why many apps “unlock” content or features immediately on the device** and then rely on server notifications or server receipt verification to keep a canonical record of the purchase. If you wait solely for the App Store Server Notification to confirm the subscription, your user might be stuck waiting for 5, 10, or 30+ seconds—often leading to a poor user experience.

---

## 4. Best Practice: Use the Local Callback for Immediate Unlock

1. **Implement `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` (StoreKit 1) or StoreKit 2** in the app.
2. When you get a `.purchased` transaction, unlock features right away (optimistically).
3. In the background, verify the receipt on your server or wait for the server notification to finalize your backend’s record.
4. If, for any reason, the receipt verification fails, you can revoke access or prompt the user.

This flow ensures the user sees the subscription active immediately after paying, rather than waiting on Apple’s server notification round-trip.

---

### Conclusion

Yes—barring unusual circumstances, your app *does* receive a near-immediate callback from StoreKit confirming that the user purchased a product or subscription. This is the standard approach to provide a responsive purchase experience. The slowness you’ve described is usually associated with App Store Server Notifications, *not* with local callbacks on the device.
