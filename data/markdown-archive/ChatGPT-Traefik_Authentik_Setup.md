Below is a step-by-step guide for getting this docker-compose stack up and running so that you can:

1. Access Authentik via the `login.apsjado.com` domain.
2. Use it as a Single Sign-On (SSO) and identity provider for your other homelab services behind Traefik.

---

## 1. **Domain & DNS Setup**

1. **DNS A Record**:
   - Make sure `login.apsjado.com` is pointed to the public IP (or appropriate IP) of your server.
   - If you are on a residential network behind NAT, forward ports 80 and 443 to your Docker host.

2. **Ports**:
   - Your router/firewall must allow inbound TCP connections on ports **80** (for HTTP challenge) and **443** (for HTTPS).

---

## 2. **Create/Arrange Your Files and Folders**

1. **docker-compose.yml** (the file you’ve shared).
   - Store the YAML configuration in a directory, e.g., `/home/docker/authentik/`.
   - Make sure indentation is correct and that your environment variables (like the `AUTHENTIK_POSTGRESQL__PASSWORD`) are set appropriately.

2. **traefik.yml**
   - Inside the same folder, create a `traefik.yml`.
   - A simple example (to get started) might look like this:
     ```yaml
     api:
       dashboard: true

     entryPoints:
       web:
         address: ":80"
       websecure:
         address: ":443"

     providers:
       docker:
         endpoint: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
         exposedByDefault: false

     certificatesResolvers:
       letsencrypt:
         acme:
           email: "youremail@example.com"
           storage: "/letsencrypt/acme.json"
           httpChallenge:
             entryPoint: "web"
     ```
   - This lines up with the flags (`--api.dashboard=true`, etc.) you put under `command:` in your `traefik` service. If you prefer using only CLI flags, that’s fine—just ensure the settings match.

3. **acme.json**
   - Create an empty file named `acme.json` in the same directory.
   - **Secure the file** so Traefik can write certificates to it:
     ```bash
     touch acme.json
     chmod 600 acme.json
     ```
   - If this file is not writeable, Traefik can fail to store/renew certificates.

---

## 3. **Review Your Environment Variables**

In your `authentik_server` and `authentik_worker` services, the environment variables should match your desired domain and credentials:

```yaml
environment:
  AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY: "super-random-secret-key"
  AUTHENTIK_HOST: "https://login.apsjado.com"
  AUTHENTIK_POSTGRESQL__HOST: postgresql
  AUTHENTIK_POSTGRESQL__USER: authentik
  AUTHENTIK_POSTGRESQL__PASSWORD: your_db_password
  AUTHENTIK_POSTGRESQL__NAME: authentik
  AUTHENTIK_REDIS__HOST: redis
  AUTHENTIK_REDIS__PORT: "6379"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@example.com"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "changeit"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: "admin"
```

- **SECRET\_KEY**: Make sure you replace `"super-random-secret-key"` with a truly random value.
- **AUTHENTIK\_BOOTSTRAP** credentials will help you do the initial admin login. You can later change them in the Authentik UI.

---

## 4. **Bring It All Up**

From within your project directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **Verify containers**:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  You should see containers for `traefik`, `authentik_server`, `authentik_worker`, `authentik_postgres`, and `authentik_redis`.

- **Check Traefik Logs** for any ACME (Let’s Encrypt) errors or certificate issues:
  ```bash
  docker logs traefik
  ```
  You should see ACME requesting a certificate for `login.apsjado.com`.

- **Check Authentik Logs** if you suspect database or redis connectivity issues:
  ```bash
  docker logs authentik_server
  ```

---

## 5. **Initial Login to Authentik**

1. **Navigate to**: <https://login.apsjado.com>
   - The first time you visit, your certificate may still be generating, so be patient or check the Traefik logs if you get an error.
2. **Login with**:
   - **Username**: `admin` (from `AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME`)
   - **Password**: `changeit` (from `AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
   - Then you can change these credentials in the Authentik UI immediately for security.

---

## 6. **Securing Your Homelab Services**

Now that you have Authentik as an identity provider, you can configure your other containers to use Authentik for SSO. Generally, this goes one of two ways in a Traefik-based homelab:

1. **Reverse Proxy Forward Auth**:
   - You protect a service by having Traefik “forward” authentication to Authentik. That means Authentik controls the login screen, and only if the user is authenticated does Traefik allow access to the service.

2. **Authentik Outposts** (or “Providers”):
   - Authentik has the notion of “Outposts” or dedicated application providers that can integrate more tightly with external services.

### Example: Using Forward Auth in Traefik

Here’s a simplified example of how you might protect a service at `https://myservice.apsjado.com` using Authentik as a Forward Auth provider:

```yaml
myservice:
  image: your-image
  container_name: myservice
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - traefik-net
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    - "traefik.http.routers.myservice.rule=Host(`myservice.apsjado.com`)"
    - "traefik.http.routers.myservice.entrypoints=websecure"
    - "traefik.http.routers.myservice.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
    - "traefik.http.services.myservice.loadbalancer.server.port=80"

    # Forward Auth
    - "traefik.http.routers.myservice.middlewares=myservice-auth"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.myservice-auth.forwardauth.address=https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/traefik-forwardauth/" 
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.myservice-auth.forwardauth.trustForwardHeader=true"
```

- The `forwardauth.address` typically is the URL provided by Authentik once you set up a Traefik Forward Auth Outpost in the Authentik UI.
- Ensure your Traefik + Authentik SSL certificate is valid so that the `forwardauth.address` is reachable via HTTPS.

You’ll configure the “Forward Auth” flow in Authentik by creating a new **Provider** → **Outpost** → **Traefik Forward Auth**. After it’s created, Authentik will give you the exact endpoint to plug in as `forwardauth.address`.

Once that’s set:

- When a user visits `myservice.apsjado.com`, they’ll be redirected to Authentik to log in (if not already).
- After a successful login, they’ll be allowed through the reverse proxy to access your service.

---

## 7. **Next Steps and Best Practices**

1. **Change All Default Passwords**:
   - Postgres DB password (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`)
   - Authentik admin bootstrap password
   - `AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY`

2. **Back Up Your Authentik Data**:
   - Regularly back up the Authentik Postgres database.
   - Keep a secure copy of your `acme.json` if you want to preserve existing certificates.

3. **Hardening**:
   - If you like to incorporate more security, consider adding `securityheaders` or rate-limiting middlewares in Traefik.
   - Monitor your logs in Authentik for unusual access patterns.

4. **Explore Authentik Features**:
   - Custom policies, group-based access, SAML/OIDC integration, and other advanced identity management features.

---

## 8. **Common Troubleshooting**

1. **Can’t Access `login.apsjado.com`**
   - Verify DNS is set correctly.
   - Double-check firewall and port forwarding (80 → server:80, 443 → server:443).

2. **Certificate Errors**
   - Make sure `acme.json` has `chmod 600`.
   - Check that you used a valid email for Let’s Encrypt.
   - Wait a few minutes for Let’s Encrypt rate limits if you’ve made many attempts.

3. **Authentik DB or Redis Connection Failures**
   - Check your environment variables (hostnames, passwords) in the compose file.
   - Ensure the `postgresql` and `redis` containers are healthy with `docker logs`.

4. **Looping Auth or 403 Errors** (with Forward Auth)
   - Confirm the `forwardauth.address` is correct and uses HTTPS.
   - Ensure your Authentik Outpost is configured for the correct redirect URL (matching your domain).

---

### Summary

By combining **Traefik** and **Authentik**, you have a powerful setup that provides automatic HTTPS, a central login (SSO) for your homelab, and fine-grained access control. The main steps are:

1. Point your domain to your server.
2. Set up Traefik with valid Let’s Encrypt challenge config and an `acme.json` file.
3. Launch Authentik containers with a Postgres and Redis backend.
4. Log in with your bootstrap admin credentials at `https://login.apsjado.com`.
5. (Optionally) Set up Forward Auth or Outposts to protect additional homelab services.

With this foundation, you can expand your homelab to include containers or VMs for all kinds of services—knowing you have a secure and centralized authentication layer in place. Good luck, and enjoy exploring the deeper capabilities of Authentik and Traefik in your homelab!

By default, Authentik uses the **bootstrap admin credentials** you supplied in the environment variables. In your `docker-compose.yml`, these are set under:

```yaml
environment:
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@example.com"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "changeit"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: "admin"
```

So, you can log in using either:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `changeit`

or use:

- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `changeit`

Once you’re in, you can immediately change the admin password to something more secure in the Authentik interface.

      AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "changeit"
      AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: "admin"

these credtntials don't work

<time datetime="2025-01-18T05:25:07.459Z" title="1/18/2025, 2:25:07 PM">14:25</time>

If your configured bootstrap credentials **don’t work** (e.g. `admin` / `changeit`), a few things might be happening:

1. **Bootstrap Already Ran**\
   Authentik’s bootstrap process only runs **once** when there’s no existing database. If you changed your environment variables after the initial setup—or if a previous Authentik database volume still exists—then Authentik won’t re-run the bootstrap with the new credentials.

2. **Typos or Spacing**\
   Make sure there are no trailing spaces in the username or password and that you are using the **exact** credentials defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Database Persistence**\
   Even if you change environment variables, the old admin credentials might still be in the database if you didn’t remove the Postgres volume or reinitialize the database.

---

## How to Fix / Reset the Admin Password

### Option A: Run Authentik’s Management Command

1. **Open a shell** inside your Authentik server container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec authentik_server /bin/bash
   ```
   (If you’re using Docker Swarm or a slightly different setup, adjust accordingly.)

2. **Reset the admin password** by running an Authentik management command. For example:
   ```bash
   authentik manage ak user set_password --user admin --password "NewPasswordHere"
   ```
   - Replace `admin` with whatever the admin username should be if you changed it.
   - Replace `NewPasswordHere` with your desired password.

3. **Try logging in** again at <https://login.apsjado.com> using the updated credentials.

### Option B: Wipe & Re-Bootstrap (if you’re okay with losing data)

If this is a fresh installation and you don’t mind **deleting** your existing Authentik database to re-run the bootstrap process:

1. **Stop the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Remove volumes** for your Postgres database (and Redis if needed). If you’re storing volumes locally, this might look like:
   ```bash
   docker volume rm authentik_authentik_postgres_data
   # or check with docker volume ls / docker volume rm as appropriate
   ```
   The exact volume name may vary depending on how your `docker-compose.yml` is set up.

3. **Start up again**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Now Authentik should see an empty database and run the bootstrap process with the credentials set in your `docker-compose.yml`. Check the Authentik container logs to confirm the admin user is created.

---

## Double-Check Your Environment Variables

In your `docker-compose.yml` for the `authentik_server` and `authentik_worker`:

```yaml
environment:
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL: "green.text5235@fastmail.com"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "changeit"
  AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: "admin"
```

- **Ensure** these are what you really want.
- **Confirm** you’re running the updated file (no old versions).
- **Check** for any extra quotes, trailing spaces, or YAML indentation issues.

---

### Summary

- **Most likely cause**: The initial bootstrap already happened before you updated or confirmed these credentials.
- **Quick fix**: Use the Authentik management command to reset the admin password (`ak user set_password`).
- **Alternative**: Wipe your Authentik/DB volumes if you’re fine starting from scratch.

Once you’ve reset the password (or re-bootstrapped), you should be able to log in at <https://login.apsjado.com> with your updated admin credentials. After that, you can set up additional providers, outposts, or forward auth to secure the rest of your homelab services.

I can't log in to authentik

In case you can't login anymore, perhaps due to an incorrectly configured stage or a failed flow import, you can create a recovery key.
caution

This recovery key will give whoever has the link direct access to your instances. Keep this key safe.

To create the key, run the following command:

docker compose run --rm server create_recovery_key 10 akadmin

For Kubernetes, run

kubectl exec -it deployment/authentik-worker -c worker -- ak create_recovery_key 10 akadmin

or, for CLI, run

ak create_recovery_key 10 akadmin

This will output a link, that can be used to instantly gain access to authentik as the user specified above. The link is valid for amount of years specified above, in this case, 10 years.

<time datetime="2025-01-18T05:33:51.836Z" title="1/18/2025, 2:33:51 PM">14:33</time>

In the official Authentik docs, the example command uses `server` because that’s what their sample `docker-compose.yml` calls the service. In **your** `docker-compose.yml`, the service is named:

```yaml
authentik_server:
  container_name: authentik_server
  # ...
```

So, trying to run `docker compose run --rm server create_recovery_key 10 akadmin` will fail with **`no such service: server`** because your service name is actually `authentik_server`.

---

## How to Create a Recovery Key in Your Setup

### **Option A: Use `docker compose exec`**

1. **Open a terminal** on your Docker host.
2. Run the following command (assuming your Authentik admin username is `admin`):
   ```bash
   docker compose exec authentik_server ak create_recovery_key 10 admin
   ```
   - **Note**: If you created your admin user as something else (e.g. `akadmin`), replace the `admin` part accordingly.
3. This should output a **Recovery Key link**, which grants access to Authentik as that user for the specified time period (10 years in this example).

### **Option B: Use a Bash Shell in the Container**

Alternatively, you can **shell** into the container and run the command directly:

1. **Shell into the container**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec authentik_server /bin/bash
   ```
2. **Run the Authentik CLI**:
   ```bash
   ak create_recovery_key 10 admin
   ```
   or, if you prefer:
   ```bash
   authentik manage ak create_recovery_key 10 admin
   ```
3. Copy the recovery key link from the CLI output.

### **Option C: Use `docker compose run` (less common)**

If you really want to use `docker compose run --rm ...` approach, your command should reference **`authentik_server`** (the name in your Compose file), not `server`:

```bash
docker compose run --rm authentik_server ak create_recovery_key 10 admin
```

However, sometimes the `run` approach won’t pick up the same environment variables as the running container. Usually, **Option A** (exec) is simpler because it uses the already-running container with the correct environment.

---

## Verify the Username

Be sure you’re using the correct username. In your Compose file, you specified:

```yaml
AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME: "admin"
```

If you used something different like `"akadmin"`, you should replace `admin` with `akadmin` in the recovery key command.

---

## Summary

- The **service name** in your Compose file is `authentik_server`, not `server`.
- Either **`docker compose exec authentik_server ak create_recovery_key 10 admin`** or entering the container via `exec` and running `ak create_recovery_key` will generate a link.
- That link grants you immediate access to Authentik even if you’re locked out.

Afterward, you can log in and fix any misconfigurations (like resetting the admin password, updating login stages, etc.).

Congratulations on getting Authentik up and running! Once you have a functional baseline, you’ll want to **harden** your environment beyond just the default username/password setup. Below are some best-practice suggestions for improving security in Authentik and your broader homelab environment.

## 1. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**MFA** (often TOTP-based or WebAuthn/FIDO2 hardware keys) is one of the most important improvements you can make.

1. **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)**
   - Authentik supports TOTP codes through common authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
   - You can enable TOTP in Authentik by creating or modifying a login flow that includes a TOTP stage.
   - Once enabled, users will be prompted to scan a QR code with their authenticator app, adding a second factor of authentication.

2. **WebAuthn (FIDO2) / Security Keys**
   - If you want to use physical keys (e.g., YubiKeys) or platform authenticators like Windows Hello/Touch ID, you can configure Authentik’s **WebAuthn** stage.
   - WebAuthn is often stronger than TOTP, as it resists phishing more effectively and can rely on hardware tokens.

### How to Add MFA in Authentik

- **Go to**: Authentik Admin → **Flows** → (Select or Create a “Login” flow).
- **Add** or **Insert** an MFA stage (like TOTP or WebAuthn) into the flow.
- **Configure** user prompts, fallback behavior, and how strictly you want MFA enforced.
- **Test** thoroughly with your own account(s) before rolling out to all users.

---

## 2. Rotate or Disable the Bootstrap Admin

1. **Remove or Rename the Default Admin**:
   - By default, Authentik sets up an “admin” user from bootstrap. Attackers often try “admin” as a username.
   - Either **rename** the admin account to something non-obvious or **create** a separate superuser account for daily tasks, then disable the bootstrap admin.

2. **Use Strong Passwords**:
   - For any remaining admin account, **replace** “changeit” with a very strong, randomly generated password.
   - Consider using a **password manager** like Bitwarden, KeePass, or 1Password to store it.

3. **Check for Additional “Default” Accounts**:
   - Ensure you don’t have leftover test or demo accounts from initial testing.

---

## 3. Lock Down Admin Access

1. **Enforce MFA** specifically for admin roles.

2. **Separate Standard User vs. Admin Accounts**:
   - Use your admin account only for system changes.
   - Use a regular user account (with lower privileges) for day-to-day.

3. **Limit IP Ranges (Optional)**
   - If you have a known static IP, you can implement an IP-based policy for the admin interface.
   - Within Authentik, you can create or adjust a **Policy** that checks the user’s IP address and only allows admin access from specific ranges.

---

## 4. Harden Your Authentik Deployment

1. **Update Your Environment Variables**
   - Make sure the `AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY` is truly random and changed from the default.
   - Keep all secrets (DB password, Redis password if you set one, etc.) out of version control and in a `.env` file or a secrets manager.

2. **TLS Everywhere**
   - You already have HTTPS via Let’s Encrypt for `https://login.apsjado.com`.
   - **Ensure** you don’t have any non-HTTPS endpoints exposed.
   - In your network, prefer secure connections between containers if possible (though Docker overlay networks are typically internal and not directly exposed).

3. **Keep Container Images Updated**
   - Periodically pull the latest **Authentik** image (`ghcr.io/goauthentik/server:latest`) and other service images.
   - **Check release notes** before upgrading to ensure you’re aware of any breaking changes.

4. **Docker Security**
   - If your `docker-compose` environment is exposed to the public internet, consider placing it behind a **firewall** or limiting Docker socket access.
   - **Never** expose your Docker socket publicly.
   - Some folks use `Socket Proxy` or something like `swarm-listener` for better security.

5. **Backup & Recovery Strategy**
   - Regularly **backup** your Postgres data. This includes user accounts, flows, policies—everything critical for Authentik.
   - **Test** your backups to ensure you can restore if something goes wrong.

---

## 5. Strengthen Auth Policies and Flows

1. **Password Policies**
   - In Authentik, you can configure complexity requirements and rotation policies.
   - Enforcing minimal length, requiring special characters, etc., ensures stronger user passwords.

2. **Stage & Flow Customization**
   - For extra security, you can add steps like Terms of Service prompts, security questions (less recommended than TOTP, though), or disclaimers.
   - Confirm your login flow’s “recovery” or “password reset” steps are safe and can’t be abused.

3. **Event Logging & Monitoring**
   - Authentik logs key events (e.g., login successes, failures, password changes).
   - Consider setting up an external log collector (ELK stack, Grafana Loki, etc.) or notifications so you’re alerted on unusual login activity or multiple failed attempts.

---

## 6. Use Authentik as a Forward Auth or SSO for Services

**Prevent** direct, unauthenticated access to your services by:

1. **Forward Auth** (Traefik Middleware)
   - Every user hitting a service is redirected to Authentik to authenticate.
   - Once logged in, users are allowed through.
   - Great for dashboards, admin interfaces, or any service that doesn’t natively support OIDC/SAML.

2. **Native OIDC/SAML Integration**
   - If a service supports OAuth2/OIDC or SAML, you can configure Authentik as an IdP.
   - Then, the user logs in via Authentik’s flow and gets single sign-on (SSO).

Both approaches ensure that **one set** of strong credentials (with MFA) secures your entire homelab.

---

## 7. IP Filtering, Rate Limiting, or WAF

If you want to further restrict traffic:

1. **Traefik Middlewares**
   - You can add rate-limiting or even geo-blocking.
   - For example, if you only expect logins from your own country or IP range, you can block everything else.

2. **Cloudflare or Other Reverse Proxies**
   - Some homelabbers place Cloudflare in front for DDoS protection or extra WAF-like rules (e.g., blocking known malicious IPs).

3. **Fail2Ban**
   - While Authentik can handle lockouts, using Fail2Ban at the network layer (looking for repeated failed logins) adds another layer of security.
   - You’d point Fail2Ban to the Authentik logs or Traefik logs and ban offending IPs.

---

## 8. Audit and Periodic Reviews

1. **User Audit**
   - If you invite multiple users to your Authentik environment, periodically check which accounts exist, what roles they have, and if they’re still needed.

2. **Flow and Policy Checks**
   - Over time, you might add custom flows or tweak existing ones. Occasionally review them to ensure no misconfiguration leaves a backdoor.

3. **Version Updates**
   - Keep an eye on release notes from Authentik’s GitHub or official documentation. Security patches often come with new releases.

---

# Conclusion

1. **MFA**: Add TOTP or WebAuthn for all admin (and ideally, all user) accounts.
2. **Secure Admin**: Rename the bootstrap admin, enforce strong passwords, or disable it in favor of a new admin user.
3. **Harden the Deployment**: Rotate secrets, keep container images updated, lock down Docker.
4. **SSO for Everything**: Use Forward Auth or native OIDC to protect all your services under Traefik.
5. **Monitor & Log**: Set up alerts or logs for suspicious access or repeated login failures.

By layering MFA, strict password policies, proper logging, and limiting access, you’ll significantly improve the security posture of your Authentik setup—and your homelab as a whole. Enjoy your newly secured environment, and don’t forget to back up your data regularly!

Below is a step-by-step guide to protect your **Outline Wiki** behind **Authentik**. We’ll walk through configuring Outline to use Authentik as an **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** identity provider. Once set up, any user visiting your Outline URL will be prompted to log in (with MFA, if you’ve enabled it) through Authentik.

> **Tip:** Using Authentik as an OIDC provider is typically more robust than Traefik’s Forward Auth approach if the app (Outline) supports OAuth/OIDC natively—like Outline does.

---

## 1. **Prerequisites & Overview**

1. **Outline Wiki** container running behind Traefik.
2. **Authentik** already up and running (with a valid domain and HTTPS).
3. **DNS & SSL** in place (Traefik issuing certificates, so `wiki.example.com` / `outline.apsjado.com`, etc. is accessible over HTTPS).
4. **Admin access** to Authentik to create an OIDC provider.

---

## 2. **Create an OIDC Provider in Authentik**

Inside Authentik, an OIDC “Provider” (often called an “Application”) is what Outline will use to authenticate. Here’s how:

1. **Log into Authentik** as an admin.
2. Go to **Applications** → **Create** (or **Add Application**):
   - **Name**: e.g., `Outline Wiki`
   - (Optional) **Slug**: `outline-wiki`
3. Once the application is created, go to the **Providers** tab (in some Authentik versions, you might see “Add Provider” directly).
4. **Create a new OIDC Provider** linked to that application:
   - **Name**: e.g., `Outline OIDC Provider`
   - **Redirect URIs**: You must include your Outline site’s callback URL, such as `https://wiki.example.com/auth/redirect` (we’ll confirm the path in the Outline docs).
   - **Client Type**: Usually `confidential` (since we’ll use a client secret).
   - **Scopes**: Typically `openid profile email` are standard.
   - **Authorization Flow**: `code` (the common OIDC flow).
   - **Signing Key**: If asked, pick or create a signing key (most setups use the default).

> **Note:** In Authentik, under **Providers** → **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** → **Identification** you might see an “Issuer” URL (something like `https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/<some-id>/`). That’s your OIDC metadata endpoint.

### Retrieve Your Client ID & Secret

Once the **OIDC Provider** is saved, Authentik will generate:

- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**
- **Issuer / Discovery URL** (the **well-known** endpoint)

Keep these handy; you’ll need them for Outline’s config.

---

## 3. **Configure Outline to Use Authentik OIDC**

Outline supports OIDC via environment variables. The specifics can vary slightly by Outline versions, but generally you’ll set:

1. **`OIDC_ENABLED`**: `true`
2. **`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`**: the Client ID from Authentik
3. **`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`**: the Client Secret from Authentik
4. **`OIDC_AUTH_URI`**: Authentik’s Authorization Endpoint, e.g.:
   ```
   https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/<PROVIDER_SLUG>/authorize
   ```
   Or if you see a discovery URL (which might be `.../.well-known/openid-configuration`), Outline typically needs explicit endpoints for **auth**, **token**, **userinfo**.
5. **`OIDC_TOKEN_URI`**: Authentik’s Token Endpoint, e.g.:
   ```
   https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/<PROVIDER_SLUG>/token
   ```
6. **`OIDC_USERINFO_URI`**: Authentik’s Userinfo Endpoint, e.g.:
   ```
   https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/<PROVIDER_SLUG>/userinfo
   ```
7. **`OIDC_SCOPES`**: Typically `openid profile email`
8. **`OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME`**: Something like `"Authentik"` (appears on Outline’s login screen)
9. **`OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM`**: Typically `preferred_username` or `email` (depends on how you want Outline to identify users)
10. **`OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM`**: Usually `email`

> **Check Outline’s docs** for the exact environment variable names. For example:\
> [Outline Wiki OIDC Documentation](https://www.getoutline.com/wiki/third-party-oidc-providers)\
> They provide sample `.env` keys like:
>
> ```
> OIDC_ENABLED=true
> OIDC_CLIENT_ID=...
> OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=...
> OIDC_AUTH_URI=...
> OIDC_TOKEN_URI=...
> OIDC_USERINFO_URI=...
> OIDC_SCOPES=openid profile email
> OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME="Authentik"
> OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM=email
> OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM=email
> ...
> ```

### Example Outline `.env`

```bash
# Outline URL
URL="https://wiki.example.com"

# Enable OIDC
OIDC_ENABLED=true
OIDC_CLIENT_ID="your_authentik_client_id"
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="your_authentik_client_secret"

# Endpoints (swap <PROVIDER_SLUG> with your actual slug or provider path)
OIDC_AUTH_URI="https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-wiki/authorize"
OIDC_TOKEN_URI="https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-wiki/token"
OIDC_USERINFO_URI="https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-wiki/userinfo"

OIDC_SCOPES="openid profile email"
OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME="Authentik"
OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM="email"
OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM="email"

# Outline database, Redis, etc. config here...
```

Then **redeploy** Outline with these environment variables to pick up the OIDC changes.

---

## 4. **Set the Redirect URI in Authentik to Match Outline**

Back in your Authentik OIDC Provider settings:

- **Redirect URIs** should match Outline’s **callback URL**:
  - Typically Outline listens at: `https://wiki.example.com/auth/redirect`
  - Check Outline docs or logs to be sure.
  - If Outline logs say it’s trying to redirect to `https://wiki.example.com/auth/oidc.callback` or something else, match that.

> If you don’t add the exact callback URL in Authentik’s “Redirect URIs,” you’ll get an OAuth error (e.g., “invalid\_client” or “redirect\_uri mismatch”).

---

## 5. **Test Your Setup**

1. Go to your Outline URL, e.g., `https://wiki.example.com`.
2. **Click “Sign in”**. You should see a new option or button referencing “Authentik” (based on `OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME`).
3. **Authenticate** via Authentik. You’ll be redirected to `https://login.apsjado.com` to log in.
4. If it’s your **first time** logging in with that Authentik user in Outline, you’ll typically get a prompt to create or confirm your user account in Outline.

### Common Troubleshooting

- **Redirect URI Mismatch**: Ensure both Outline and Authentik have the exact same callback URL.
- **Invalid Scope**: If Outline demands a certain scope (like `profile`), ensure it’s enabled in Authentik.
- **SSL Issues**: If Outline or Authentik uses self-signed certificates (not recommended), you may need additional config. Typically using Let’s Encrypt with Traefik solves that.

---

## 6. (Optional) Enforce Auth for All Wiki Access

If you want **no public access** to Outline:

- Outline’s default behavior is to **require** login to see anything beyond a basic landing page.
- If you have an older version that might show public spaces, you can disable “Public sharing” in Outline’s settings or require a user sign in for all pages.

---

## 7. (Optional) Use Authentik Policies & MFA

Because you’re now centralizing logins in Authentik:

1. **Enable MFA** (TOTP/WebAuthn) in Authentik.
2. **Enforce** that policy for all user logins by adjusting the “login flow” to include a TOTP or WebAuthn stage.
3. Outline won’t need separate MFA support; the user flow is fully handled by Authentik.

---

## 8. **Maintain & Monitor**

- **Keep Authentik Updated**: Check for new releases; they often include security and feature updates.
- **Rotate Secrets**: Periodically rotate your OIDC Client Secret.
- **Logs**: Monitor Authentik and Outline logs for suspicious login attempts or errors.

---

# Summary

By using Authentik as your **OpenID Connect** provider for Outline Wiki, you achieve:

- **Single Sign-On**: One set of credentials (with MFA, if enabled) for Outline and other homelab services.
- **Centralized Policy & Access Control**: Manage user provisioning, password resets, and multi-factor from Authentik.
- **Future Integration**: You can similarly integrate other apps that support OAuth/OIDC or SAML with Authentik.

**Next Steps**:

- Enable MFA (TOTP or WebAuthn) in Authentik’s login flow.
- Create additional Policies/Groups in Authentik if you need role-based access in Outline.
- Expand this approach to secure other services behind Authentik SSO or use Traefik Forward Auth for apps that don’t have built-in OIDC support.

Happy wiki-ing! If you run into any snags, check the Authentik logs for OIDC errors and confirm your Outline callback URL exactly matches what’s in Authentik’s provider config.

To integrate **Outline Wiki** with Authentik using OpenID Connect, you'll want to create an **OAuth2/OpenID Provider** in Authentik. Below is a quick walkthrough of what to do when you see that “Select type” screen in Authentik.

---

## 1. Choose the **OAuth2/OpenID Provider** Option

From the list of provider types:

1. Go to **Applications** (or **Providers**) in Authentik’s admin area.
2. Click **New provider**.
3. Select **“OAuth2/OpenID Provider”**.

This will create the OIDC endpoint Outline can use for single sign-on (SSO).

---

## 2. Link the Provider to an Application

Typically, Authentik has you create or link to an existing **Application** object. The naming can vary slightly by Authentik version, but the idea is:

1. Either **create** a new Application (e.g., “Outline Wiki”) or **edit** an existing one.
2. In the **Providers** tab of that Application, choose “Add Provider” → select **OAuth2/OpenID**.

You’ll end up on a form that looks something like:

- **Name**: “Outline OIDC Provider”

- **Slug**: (optional) “outline-oidc” (this becomes part of the provider’s URL)

- **Redirect URIs**: Where Authentik should send users after successful login. Typically for Outline, it’s:
  ```
  https://wiki.example.com/auth/redirect
  ```
  (Check your Outline logs or docs if it differs.)

- **Client Type**: `confidential`

- **Scopes**: typically `openid profile email`

**Important**: Make sure the **Redirect URI** you set in Authentik **exactly matches** what Outline expects. Otherwise you’ll see a “redirect\_uri mismatch” error.

---

## 3. Save & Retrieve Your OIDC Credentials

Once you **save** the provider, Authentik will generate:

1. **Client ID**
2. **Client Secret**
3. **Issuer / Endpoint URLs**
   - The **Authorization Endpoint** will typically look like:
     ```
     https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-oidc/authorize
     ```
   - The **Token Endpoint**:
     ```
     https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-oidc/token
     ```
   - The **Userinfo Endpoint**:
     ```
     https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-oidc/userinfo
     ```

You’ll need these details (especially Client ID, Client Secret, and the endpoints) for your Outline configuration.

---

## 4. Configure Outline to Use Authentik OIDC

In Outline’s `.env` (or however you configure environment variables), set:

```bash
URL="https://wiki.example.com"

OIDC_ENABLED=true
OIDC_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_ID"
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_SECRET"

# Authentik Endpoints
OIDC_AUTH_URI="https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-oidc/authorize"
OIDC_TOKEN_URI="https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-oidc/token"
OIDC_USERINFO_URI="https://login.apsjado.com/application/o/outline-oidc/userinfo"

OIDC_SCOPES="openid profile email"
OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME="Authentik"
OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM="email"
OIDC_EMAIL_CLAIM="email"
```

- **OIDC\_USERNAME\_CLAIM** and **OIDC\_EMAIL\_CLAIM** can vary depending on how you want Outline to identify users (often both are `email`).

After you save these changes, **redeploy** or restart the Outline container so it picks up the new environment variables.

---

## 5. Test the Login Flow

1. Go to `https://wiki.example.com`.
2. Click “Sign In” on Outline.
3. You should see an option for OIDC or “Authentik” (depending on your **OIDC\_DISPLAY\_NAME** value).
4. When you click that, you’ll be redirected to `https://login.apsjado.com` (Authentik) to log in.
5. After successful Authentik login (with MFA if you’ve set it up), you’ll be redirected back to Outline as an authenticated user.

---

## 6. Lock It Down and Enforce MFA (Optional but Recommended)

Since you’re now using Authentik:

- **Enforce MFA** in Authentik’s login flow so Outline also requires MFA.
- Adjust policies (IP restrictions, group membership checks, etc.) if you want more fine-grained access control.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Redirect URI mismatch**: Make sure the URL in Outline’s `.env` exactly matches the Redirect URI in Authentik’s provider settings.
- **Invalid Client**: Ensure the correct **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are used.
- **Scope Errors**: Some versions of Outline might require certain scopes (`openid profile email`). Confirm Authentik is providing them.

---

# Summary

1. **Select “OAuth2/OpenID Provider”** in Authentik when creating a new provider for Outline.
2. **Configure** your Redirect URIs and get your **Client ID** / **Client Secret**.
3. **Set** Outline’s `.env` variables to those Authentik endpoints and credentials.
4. **Test** the login flow to ensure it redirects to Authentik and back to Outline correctly.

That’s it! You’ll have a seamless SSO experience for Outline Wiki secured by Authentik, with all the usual benefits of centralized authentication and optional MFA.
