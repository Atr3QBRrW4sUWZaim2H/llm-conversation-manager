Integrating Design and Applicant Insights
Anita and Deepti discussed the need for a more integrated and cohesive design for the view job page to avoid disjointed navigation. They also discussed the emotional impact of applicant insights on job seekers, suggesting that the module should be responsive to the match level to provide actionable feedback. Deepti suggested that the module could provide guidance on how to improve skills or build qualifications. They also discussed the potential of integrating with Ace or Pathfinder for upskilling. Anita highlighted the importance of incorporating detailed skills and experience into the module to avoid it being seen as noise. They also discussed the implementation of the Crotaxo project, which aims to provide a deeper understanding of job seekers' skills and experience, but noted that its full impact on data quality is currently unknown.

Alright. So this is the readout for the indeed! Pro Mvp. In the wild evaluation I will say I,
a lot of this is focused on pro. But some of these insights do relate to premium, and a lot of the more major discussion in this readout is related to premium. So just kind of keep that in mind. I know it's gonna be a little bit confusing as we go through this to separate pro from premium. But we will kind of be talking about both here.
So why are we here again? We wanted to know what the real world experience of our pro features is we evaluated prototyped versions and concepts, and all of that of these different features. But this is the 1st time that we've really gotten the chance to see how they are really performing in real life.
And so what we did is an in the wild study or a contextual inquiry. It involves just observing participants as they use the product in their natural environment. So this was a remote study. So you know, they were at home. There's not a controlled lab setting. But it's real world context supposed to kind of capture that authentic behavior and interactions and challenges.
And so that this helps us identify usability problems, any issues with effectiveness or relevance of the information that we're surfacing as well as identifying any of those user needs that remain unmet and identifying any ways that we can improve our designs to align better with our user goals and contexts.
So we spoke with 6 English speaking job seekers in the Us. Who are currently enrolled in pro. All of the participants that we talked to had at least some prior work experience in their field of interest. About half of them were mid to intermediate level, and then about half of them identified as being senior or executive level.
and most of them were currently employed, and were non urgently or casually searching for work. Only one of our participants in this study was an urgent job seeker.
so before I jump into the learnings, any questions about the study setup, or or who we talked to?
Okay, perfect.
So what did we learn overall?
The 1st thing that I that I want to. You know, iterate and and really underscore for everyone here is the concepts. Do continue to resonate. We. We've heard this, you know, continuously, as we've been working on this project, that people really like these ideas. And in this case,
people particularly liked that we weren't charging them. For anything, you know. One of our participants here, Shakira was saying. I really like it a lot. I like that, indeed, isn't charging anyone or trying to gain something new. So she really likes it. So far. And she was really glad that she was able to try it out
and you know this was this was a sentiment that was echoed by several other participants as well, but that being said there are some implementation challenges that we need to address.
1st and foremost is we need to show more job seeker awareness. So I'm going to play a clip of 2 of our participants reviewing their top applicant feats, and then we will discuss. So let me know if you do not hear audio for this.
I've clicked on it before and I've clicked on the button as I go through.
but they don't seem to like these aren't positions I would apply for.
Yeah, tell me more about that. What's kind of the mismatch that you're seeing here? Well, so camp summer camp Director, that's a part time job. So even though it says full time. Yes, it's full time at the moment of while doing it. It's not full time.
Yeah. And then school director, preschool cool whatever $60,000 a year.
You know, I've never like everything that I've done has been 80 plus. So
yeah, I just wouldn't got it. My under my thought process would be if I click on this web, on this page. On this.
whatever the insights are, I would have those things.
but then I would also like I check, probably check off all the boxes for the insights, and then job details.
My, if I were a top applicant, I would at least check there.
I would be available for the things that they're offering. So like, while I want.
you know, a hundred k plus
they're all for, you know their numbers around 60, but it still is a you know. It's a number. You know, like I, I qualify for that number if that makes sense. Not necessarily that, you know. That's what I want, or that's what I'm gonna get. But I qualify for it. So that's and like, I'm looking for full time, so that should always check
I've taught the that level. So there and then, I guess. When your AI searches through this posting
it would also correlate with my resume. Well, the finance manager wouldn't be because it says, I may be missing qualifications so I, I might look at that
and I wouldn't look at the watermark application technologies, training because I don't have any experience with currency. And I know.
I know the company for for Crane and Company, and I know the people there, and I wouldn't want to work there.
Got it. So you've got pre-existing knowledge that says maybe not that one. Let's look at the top applicant jobs one more time and just kind of see? Oh, I think because we looked at this before. Yeah. So this is the same one. That was on the other list.
on that for you list. So it's refresh team manager. Yeah, just refresh
refresh. This one's a far away, this team manager
for Sam's club that's an hour away. I wouldn't drive that far.
so what we were seeing here is, you know, despite
potentially having higher qualification, overlap in the top applicant feed than we do in the, for you feed many of the jobs that we were showing in that top applicant feed. It failed to align with some of those key job seeker preferences like location and pay or schedule slash job type.
So being a top applicant
really requires more than just being qualified, the job seeker has to also be willing to accept the job. So meaning that you know, the jobs in this section should really also honor job seekers disclosed preferences.
So you know, again.
when we fail to meet this expectation, we do risk alienating our job seekers and and reinforcing any skepticism that may be born from past disappointments. With this particular feature, with the standard for you feed or with you know, features from competitors like Linkedin.
The next thing that is, you know, a major concern for us is, we really need to say more meaningful things when we're delivering insights. So I'm going to play a clip now of 2 of our participants, David and Billy, reviewing applicant insights.
So I do feel like the insights. Don't give me anything.
Okay, tell me more. Just like
I. And this could just be me being
in my thirties, and just kind of like either too young or too old. I'm not quite sure which.
if you don't know how to use it, Microsoft. By now. The suite
I don't know. I really just don't know what to do with you. It just doesn't like it, you know. My, I feel like my age. Grouping is definitely the age grouping. They grew up on it
but like everybody, even older than me, has had to use it. So I don't like that doesn't do anything for me. They mean something, but don't mean something at the same idea, right? So it doesn't like
in my mind when I look at this, I go. Okay, like sports coaching, you're applying to be a head football coach. You should be able to coach, or you should have some experience in coaching working with high schoolers. Okay, maybe you're collegiate person, not a high schooler, but 80% of the 5. So 4 out of 5 people have worked in high school before
3 out of the 5 have school experience and not just
generic. But that doesn't make sense, because if 4 out of the 5 worked with high schoolers then.
or it should be the same number. So that doesn't.
That wouldn't. That wouldn't make sense. I actually think Linkedin does a really good job at it. When you look at theirs they tend to go through with the where's the Education piece, according to you.
So now I know to. So to me, indeed, already has my information
now, and just like everything else that trust that I put it in correctly. So if you go with that it has my information that I have, you know what degrees I have, where from, and what I've done and what levels they're technically at.
So the comparison of you know, like for sports coaching
like to me, I would always have some sort of like school experience instead of school experience. It would be like level of education.
Working with high schoolers. That would be more of the you know how many years? Versus? Yeah, that kind of a thing sports coaching. Same idea. Years of experience as a
you know, head football coach, you know. My resume says I'm a head football coach for X. Amount of time like that kind of thing. You know.
Then the certification really wouldn't matter. But those kind of things versus just.
oh, yeah, this person has these
this phrase in their resume at some point. Well, no, I would. I would assume that you wouldn't apply to a job like this unless you had some.
The gentleman experience, and least being outside in the world selling things, I mean would be kind of foolish.
I would assume a hundred percent that that would apply.
So yeah, though, a lot of our participants really did appreciate having a degree of visibility into the applicant pool, the skills that we were displaying in the applicant insight section as well as the profile insight section. This applies to both because they're the same skills.
But they were often not meaningful. And so, for example, what we saw with David is Microsoft office suite skills are too common to be a differentiator. And coaching skills need to include some sort of contextual detail to be helpful like, are you coaching high school students? Are you coaching college students, are you? Instead of just coaching in general?
And in addition, depth of experience is also an important factor in gauging relative standing. And our current State doesn't include this information.
And so, as with applicant insights as well, job seekers were also really pleased to have any degree of insight or increased visibility into their profile performance. We didn't have any clips of that here, but we will discuss that later. But a lot of people didn't find the information that was shown in profile engagement to be actionable.
and a lot of job seekers are left wondering, you know, what the companies do, what roles are they hiring for why didn't this employer reach out to me? So we need to provide in our insights features more tailored guidance that reflects Job seeker strengths their preferences, their priorities, and when we don't provide that personalized or new nuanced insight.
our insights can risk being dismissed as noise.
So those 2 issues.
I don't believe, are critical for the continued ramp of pro in the Us. I definitely think we should iterate on them, and we can talk more about that in the detailed findings.
But I do believe that these issues could
really derail the paid launch of premium
launching premium without addressing these issues. Would really be testing
a version of this product that I I don't think is a true representation of its potential and I think that this would yield metrics that.
as I said, don't represent its true potential and really compromise our ability to evaluate this market.
So again, it just
really want us to, you know, reconsider what our purpose is, for, you know, pushing our international launch in Canada at the end of the month.
before we start charging. You know, I would say, we really need to address those relevance concerns with top applicant and applicant insights.
for applicant insights in particular, like, I said, aiming to consistently surface meaningful skills, insights. Especially with a paid offering. Is is going to be really important. This would require deep involvement in the Crow Taxo project which I know doesn't necessarily align with our January 30 or end of January. Rollout timeline.
So if we must launch before this is possible, my recommendation with applicant insights is just to remove the skill level applicant insights until they can be improved. We would still have applicant count information, and that alone is valuable, and it's often the standout component of the module. So I think that. Yeah, with with this particular module, if we can't fix it before rollout, I think we should simplify it
with top applicant. On the other hand.
again, in for us to sell this we need to be consistently surfacing more relevant jobs in that paid offering than we do with our free offering, and that will require changes to matching.
Don't know if that will be possible. I'm gonna be looking to our engineering friends to help us determine that. But if we must launch before these matching improvements are possible, then I would recommend that we
introduce some explainability component to address the trade offs. So something like these may not pay what you're looking for. But you are highly. You would be a top applicant, something like that, just to help job seekers understand that we understand. And we're not just ignoring their preferences.
But also de-emphasizing the value prop. Since we're not quite delivering on the promise, and also consider a price reduction, since the overall value that we would be delivering would be lower.
So those were some big takeaways. I'm just gonna pause for comments, reactions, screams of terror.
What are what are people thinking.
Luke Conlon
Luke Conlon
17:58
I'd be really interested to get the
email. So we can get the account Ids for the job seekers here, so we can look into some of the match insights and see why the matches generated were generated.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
18:10
Yeah, I I can get you all of those. All of those account. Ids for that.
Luke Conlon
Luke Conlon
18:16
Some of these are really interesting. We have
a hundred percent pay preference enforced in our filtering, which is the same as jobs for you. But all other
sections in the section feed in the future are going to be 80% pay preference. So we should be enforcing that I'd be really interested to see if there's
something like an issue with that configuration.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
18:42
Got it. Yep, yeah, I can. I'll get you those account ids right after this, Luke.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
18:50
Thank you.
Point, because I was actually noticing that the participant in that example didn't have his pay preference selected. So I'm wondering if that's why he saw a lot of results in the top applicant feed that didn't
is interesting.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
19:05
Where did? Where did you notice that Morgan.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
19:08
I noticed in the Profile Insights section there.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
19:13
There wasn't.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
19:13
The pay. The chips that are green that are selected are ones.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
19:17
Yeah.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
19:18
That
he has selected at some point, and the ones that are still gray are ones. He hasn't added to his profile yet, so I just noticed that the pay and that's
yeah selected. But I'm not sure if that was the case for the other ones like you said.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
19:32
Well, yeah, so that so I think this, this is also something that you know we we can dig into. But I think he actually did have his pay preference selected, because that is one of the requirements for being enrolled in pro at all. Is that they have to have the the minimum Viable pay identified.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
19:52
I wonder if the chip was green on that job because it didn't align with his pay preference? Then.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
19:57
Yeah, maybe.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
19:58
Be the case. Okay, yeah.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
20:00
None of the none of the jobs that we were showing in, either the for you feed or the top applicant. Feed for him matched his pay preference. So yeah, none of those would have matched.
Morgan Jamison
Morgan Jamison
20:11
Yeah, weird.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
20:14
Deep d
we are. We are chatting about the premium rollout some of the some of the concerns with applicant insights and top applicant in particular. We're just trying to discuss what we should be doing with that before we roll out. So my recommendation here is for applicant insights. We need to either
make our insights more relevant.
or, I would say, just remove those skill, level insights and just simplify that applicant insights module into the applicant, count information.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
21:02
Oh!
Anita. I joined a few minutes late, so I missed the initial part. If you don't mind. Can you recap like, what's the specific issue the insights are not meaningful. Or, what's the specific takeaway here?
Yeah, that's it.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
21:17
Okay.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
21:18
We do it, Async. If if you know folks are already up to speed, and you already have had a healthy discussion around this.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
21:24
Yeah. So the insights aren't meaningful. And so it's it's stuff like
on a sales rep job, the skills, the skill is sales. And it's like, well, yes, of course, sales is required for a sales rep job, or it'll be Microsoft Office, Microsoft. Excel Microsoft Powerpoint. So it's a you know, a situation where we're. We're showing all of these skills that aren't actually helping job seekers understand how they how competitive they are. Because
not actually a good representation of the job itself.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
21:59
Yeah. Has Ashwin? I don't see Ashwin on the call. Has he looked at some of this? Because I do remember they were changing or updating the the logic where we were looking at the job requirements and the applicant skills and then surfacing like the top 5 or so. I don't.
It's.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
22:16
That's not.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
22:17
Or.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
22:18
That's a separate issue. So the issue here is that these skill tags themselves are not meaningful. That's the. It's the whole issue that the Crow Taxo Project is trying to resolve is having skill tags that are more meaningful and more specific.
And so here, that's why you know this. This recommendation of surfacing those meaningful skill insights would require deep involvement with the Crow Taxo Project. But that is a long term effort.
And it's not something that our team would be able to tackle alone.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
22:54
Okay? So so maybe then the takeaway here, I I'm I'm taking is that
this would be valuable. But we're not surfacing the right data. Either we fix it or or we simplify it.
And I I again I should talk to. We should talk to Ashwin. I don't again. Let's talk about the blockers. Thing like, is this something a blocker? It's not like we're misrepresenting the data right? It's not valuable enough. But then we're offering bunch of other things as well. So let's maybe talk about like, how will we mitigate this? Maybe not in this call, but like I'll have like Ashwin, Calvin, and Team come back on some mitigation plans, and what our approach would be.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
23:41
I do think these 2 issues are a blocker for trying to sell this product.
I mean, I I agree with you. I don't think it's a blocker for pro in the Us. But
over half of our product is not delivering on the value props that.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
24:01
How many users have we gotten this feedback? From?
What's the sample here?
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
24:08
We talked to 7 users. But the important thing to remember with qualitative research is that it's representative users. So don't over index on the number of of participants.
I guess I guess what you what you should know here is that increasing the sample size
would only uncover more issues. It's not necessarily the case that you know, increasing the sample size would reveal that this is less of a problem. It's just increasing. The sample size would potentially reveal different problems. So that's the, you know, kind of difference with qualitative research. Here.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
24:50
And was that a consistent feedback across all.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
24:53
Yes, yes.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
24:55
Okay, and then top applicant is that the Zrps, or what's the specific issue? There.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
25:03
No, the jobs themselves weren't relevant.
So. And you know, this was Luke was saying. He wanted to look into this more. But some of the
in in some cases pay and location preferences aren't being honored
and and that is happening in both the top applicant feed and the for you feed. So it it's it's the case where both of these feeds. Aren't surfacing relevant jobs. And for pro when we're not charging for it.
That's, you know, somewhat. Okay
for premium you know, for charging for a set of jobs that is no more relevant than the jobs that we're giving them for free. I just really question why we would do that.
And so the the mitigation that I'm proposing here is we can either try to fix this matching
in in the time that we have. Don't know how possible that will be. We'll we'll need to work with engineering to figure that out.
But if we must launch before we are able to make any improvements to our matching, then we'll need to really introduce some sort of explainability component to that module to address the the mismatch that we know that we are putting in front of job seekers, and then also de-emphasize the value prop and consider a price reduction. Because
what we're offering is significantly less than what we were initially planning to offer. Whenever we were 1st discussing, pricing.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
26:48
Hey, Calvin? I know you're on the call.
so I think we discussed this one, and you had mentioned something about the spectrum of attainability and attractiveness. And right now we are indexing more on the attainability of the job as opposed to the
how attractive it would be is this related? Or do you do you guys, did you guys dig into this? And do you see this something different?
Luke Conlon
Luke Conlon
27:18
I think it's unrelated to that, because these were issues that showed up on
both feeds. I think that it's a a
issue of enforcing pay and location preferences, at least from some of the.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
27:34
And is that something we are just inheriting from the my jobs feed right now or for you jobs.
Luke Conlon
Luke Conlon
27:40
It is, I think the the confusing part that we want to look into is both feeds should be enforcing a hundred percent pay preference and all other section feeds should be enforcing 80%. So the fact that the job seeker was saying the job didn't meet his pay preference
seems like either a a miscommunication on our part, or a bug in both, feeds.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
28:04
Got it. Okay? So so you're you're on it. You're looking into that one.
Luke Conlon
Luke Conlon
28:07
Yeah, we're gonna get
we're gonna look up these accounts and match insights and see if we can find
the reasons the jobs were recommended, and what
what their pay preferences were at the time they got those matches.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
28:22
Okay, that's great. Thank you.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
28:28
Alrighty.
So yeah, those are. Those are the the primary issues. There are some additional improvements. These are all addressed in the detailed findings, so I won't go over these now. We'll get to them in in just a few minutes, but I have them here for us to revisit, and there's also a Google sheet for us to track these in later.
So with that being said, we're gonna jump into detailed findings unless anybody has any other comments or questions that they want to raise.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
29:05
1 1 question. And I I think I sat in 2 or 3 of these from A, did we test this was pro users right? Not premium. So we didn't ask anything around the pricing or anything, or did we.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
29:19
What's your? We kind of talk.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
29:21
I guess willing willingness to pay.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
29:26
Oh, it it! It varied. A lot of people said they wouldn't be willing to pay for this. Some people said they would if we were able to deliver on. You know the the promises that we're making.
It's about the same as as what we've been hearing. I think the crux of the issue right now is that we are just not delivering on the promises that we're making.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
29:49
And of all the features is my understanding still right? Like top choice, was kind of like the
the the most desirable and the.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
30:01
Top choice in
the idea of top choice, was the most desirable in terms of observed outcomes that has had the fewest. So far a lot of our participants had used top choice, but none of them had actually had a positive connection come out of that yet. So you know, a lot of them have used it. But you know, Tbd, on how successful it was for them. But I'll talk about later when we get to top choice. Kind of how that impacted their experience.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
30:33
Yeah, I would love to know, because I think the data is telling us slightly different
results. And I know James is digging more into that. It sounds like employers are responding. But then the job seekers are not responding back. So there's something happening there.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
30:51
Okay, yeah, we can. We can talk about their top choice experience. Yeah, when we get there.
Alright.
So starting with applicant insights. The the 1st thing I'll point out here is the way that we're representing applicant insights with that bar that fills up from left to right is guiding users towards some counterproductive interpretations. So one of our participants, Charles mentioned, you know, if all the bars are filled in, then I'm good to go.
because he was interpreting this as saying like, yes, you have all of these things. You're good, which is actually kind of the inverse of the way that he should be interpreting this visualization
because, you know, jobs that have high applicant overlap. That's what this is actually representing. And so we could potentially be leading users away from roles where they might stand out because of this. And so we need to find a visualization method that is more aligned with our job seekers, mental models.
ambiguous skills. This
it's a situation where you know a lot of the time, a skill will be presented in profile insights or applicant insights and a job 0 won't really know what that means. So I'm gonna play a video of a couple of our job seekers encountering one of those situations?
It asked the question, Do I have experience in civil rights?
I I
I kind of do so. It's really hard to answer that question because I do, but I don't, but I don't know to the extent that they would want to know that I'm I'm thinking. You know, they want me to at least be versed in like some legislation. You know, from the Federal level and the State level, maybe to like at least know what our
office of civil rights here does, how the school might work with it, the things that I would need to stay up to date on
as pertains to like again laws and and structuring of like policies and things. So
I'm going to assume like I said, because I've just worked in higher education, and I've worked in many different areas. I have been privy to it, you know. It might be a workshop, a training session, diversity and inclusion is all the rave now, you know, at many, at many employers. So you're being exposed to it, the awareness is increased. So yeah, I do have experience in in making sure that I keep up with those types of things. But
do I have it directly? No, like. I didn't go to school for it and
work in it day in and day out. So how would I comfortably answer that? I guess I would just have to say yes, and if I got into invited for an interview. Then I'd have to elaborate on it. Then I'll go with that.
I do have sales and computer skills. I
acute pain management. I don't have that.
but I do as a personal trainer, but not for like meds, it would have to be
fitness based.
Got it.
Okay, management and rehabilitation in mute.
It's basically sales.
Oh, I could do that.
So yeah, this was in that last clip. So what what Charles was encountering. There was acute pain management, but the job was a sales rep job, and so that was a little bit confusing to him to be like, I I don't know what this means. And when he went down to the full job description he was able to
kind of extrapolate. Okay, this is kind of what they mean. Yes, I can do this. And this is a situation that we've seen in many different studies with job seekers on view. Job and my takeaway from this is that you know, we just need to make sure that this module is more integrated with the page, so that we can avoid some of that disjointed navigation
that job seekers have to go through whenever they navigate from job details up at the top or applicant insights up at the top all the way down to the full job details, and then all the way back up to the top of the page. More effective design would just integrate this more seamlessly. With the other elements of the view. Job page.

Yeah, I I generally agree with that, Anita. I know that we have. Employers have a way to do. Must haves right like the must have, or requirements for the job. I don't know how much of that data are we leveraging when we show this prioritized list here.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
35:48
We on profile insights. We do show whether it is required or not. But that's a separate issue. The the issue here isn't that? Charles was confused about whether acute pain management was a required or an optional skill. He was confused about what that like.
what acute pain would he have to manage as a sales rep is is the issue there? Yeah.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
36:17
Got it. Yeah, it. It's not relevant to some extent.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
36:21
Yeah. Yeah. Or you know, he he had to go to the job description to figure out how exactly it was relevant. Yeah.
So the suggestion here is like, I said earlier. Just try to integrate more seamlessly with the view job page, making the experience more cohesive. By, you know, considering integrating this with profile insights job details, reducing the need for any of that additional navigation. And while we're doing that also.
you know, reconsider our visualization method to make sure that it better aligns with job seekers expectations, and we're not leading them to make those incorrect assessments.
Another thing about applicant insights is that confidence shapes the perception of the message. So when job seekers are feeling really good, they feel in control of their job search, seeing the applicant insights can be a really helpful thing. It can be seen as a trusted ally, because it gives them that at a glance visual cue
that tells them whether or not they should be paying attention to this job helps them save time.
But when job seekers are not feeling as good when they're having doubts being compared to other applicants, can
feel like we're just shining a spotlight on their insecurities. And is, might not be as helpful.
So
the takeaway here is, we should just be mindful of the emotional impact that this feedback could have on a job seeker to ensure that we're continuing to be inclusive, and that we are creating interactions that lead to sustained engagement. Over time across different mindsets because
job seekers will fluctuate between confidence and insecurity multiple times throughout their journey.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
38:28
Yeah, 100% agree with that. And I think this is where I, we still need to look at the data to see what the apply rate impact is for folks who have engaged with this feature. And if that's going up or down I I think the team is looking into that. And the other thing is to your point again for folks where and this could be a fast follow where they don't have the where. They don't look
strong. Maybe we can give them some actionability in terms of how they can get there. Right?
Yeah.
skills that they could build or so. And I think that could tie into, I guess, improving their resume or their profile, or so.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
39:04
Yeah, a hundred percent. And and that's that's essentially the recommendation here, which is having this module be responsive to the match level. So this image here is from the match. Xp vision
a year ago, maybe. But they had broken matches down into 4 different categories where it's, you know, we want to redirect non viable. So we know this isn't a match. We want to redirect you away. If it's a strong match we want to entice you to imply. If it's a top match we really wanna like compel you to apply. And if it's an unknown match, then our priority is data collection and understanding the job seeker.
So yeah, it's not necessarily a case that we
don't ever want to deter job seekers from applying to a job, because maybe it really isn't that next best step for them? So that's where you know, like, you're saying deept, providing that path forward, even if that path lies elsewhere. Is something that we potentially could do in these bad match situations. So
just a few examples here. One from Matchxp was where we were. Showing different jobs that you could apply to instead. So maybe for us, this is a situation where we could display top applicant jobs instead. Or to your point about upskilling deep. D, maybe we could integrate with Ace or pathfinder to help job seekers acquire those missing qualifications.
But yeah, alright. So this one here, we. And this is.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
40:50
Anita. Sorry. One more question or thought here and again I'll follow up with Ashwin when we were initially talking about applicant insights. I know, skills was one dimension. There's also like, Hey, these type of applicants like there are like, you know, let's say, product, they're like
15% of them are Pmm product marketing folks who are applying for this job, or 20% of them are Senior Pm's or director level or so is that something that we've considered. Have we done anything around that? And is that maybe a better data that we can easily surface?
I'm just thinking loud in terms of what we can do which is valuable and which we can quickly maybe in instrument. And again, maybe this is a discussion that we should have a follow up on. But do do you recall that we did any of that investigation early on.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
41:40
You get we we didn't
put job titles or anything like that. And we haven't actually put that in front of job seekers. We have discussed additional data points that could be helpful in determining how you stand up to the competition job. Title has never come up in that. But what I will say, what you're discussing, or what you're touching on with, like.
you know, 4 years of experience as a product manager. That is the type of thing that crow taxo would be enabling. That I don't think is necessarily something that our current skill taxonomy supports.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
42:25
I don't know. I feel like we can. Anyways, I will take this offline, but I feel like even with Llms we should be able to easily extract that data. I don't think we need a comprehensive
taxonomy logic there. But anyways we'll we'll we'll do a deep dive on this one.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
42:45
Okay, so this is the same point that we started this call with. But shallow insights do lead to disengagement. So like we were mentioning earlier, those ubiquitous skills or those overly broad skills leave users really uncertain about how their experience compares to the applicant pool and are effectively meaningless.
And so, you know, they're
those more detailed skills. And in addition, depth of experience are are really important factors engaging that under that relative comparison, and we need to incorporate those into our module
cause as long as we don't. Then we run the risk of this becoming seen as noise and being dismissed.
And so this is where the crow Taxo. This is where I'm I'm bringing this up is
Deeper understanding is the goal of the Crotaxo project. The Crotac taxonomy is supposed to support this by asking more precise questions, using Llms at an occupational level to, you know, just
at a more granular occupational level than we do currently.
And so this is in the process of being implemented in the Us. But it's very early on, and the full scope of the impact that that project will have on our data quality is currently unknown.
So I'm flagging that as as a as a risk for us as well. The Crotaxo Mvp. Is launching for select segments. I don't know what segments, specifically, that is but it's launching for some segments in the Us. On January 31, st however, there is no timeline that I know of for expansion into India and Canada.
so while Protaxo can help us make improvements for pro in the Us. We can't rely on it to make improvements for premium
so just flagging that
alright so moving on to top applicant.
And one of the things that you know we were really talking about here is that the top applicant feed, and before you feed, really feel the same, and a new lens without differentiation feels redundant.
And so James did a really good analysis of the for you and top applicant feeds to see how much like actual overlap there is, how many times do the same jobs appear in each feed, and the actual overlap is very minimal.
And so what we're seeing here is some sort of illusory overlap where, even though it's not the exact same jobs, they feel the same. And my hypothesis here is that this is because of the shared weaknesses between these feeds we're showing similarly wrong jobs. And this is overshadowing the strengths of qualification alignment that we might be having with our top applicant feeds.
So again, we we really need to figure out a way to make this feed
somehow more relevant to job seekers than their 4. You feed
So
one thing that I want to point out for pro, I'm not really concerned about this for pro because when we're presenting these different feeds as equivalent options at no additional cost. I think it's acceptable or even expected for the relevance to be about the same, and for them to be just slightly different lenses through which you're viewing the same content. That's what a lot of online streaming platforms do. That's what Netflix does.
But when we're presenting this as a paid offering that's distinct from others, that's where the problem comes in. So, without exclusivity or demonstrating any of that improved relevance. I don't see a clear reason to charge for these recommendations.
I'm gonna pause for a second and see comments in the chat.
Oh, cool! Rachel shared an analysis for applicant insights. And then Chelsea says, I wonder if we can instead introduce some design elements to job cards for these top applicant jobs? So rather than a tab. Is it a badge? Or maybe we need to rename it? Yeah, that's that's a possibility. You know. Maybe we stop saying it's top applicant. And maybe we
go towards something more like qualifications overlap or something like that. Yeah, definitely, something to explore.
Okay, continuing on. Yeah, these recommendations aren't aligned with priorities. So the the narrow criteria that we're using right now for identifying top applicants seems to be ignoring preferences like pay location and schedule. So that could be leading to a disconnect.
Another thing, though, which, Luke, this may be something to keep in mind, is a lot. Some of our participants did have simultaneous searches or were open to relocation, and they particularly struggle, struggled with pay and location relevance because they have multiple preference sets that should be considered. And our matching is known to struggle when it comes to multiple preferences. So
that could also be a factor here.
And yeah, when when relevance misses the mark, trust unravels because you know, our job seekers do expect in deeds tools to reflect their unique needs, and we risk alienating users whenever we fail to do that. And so one situation where we were presenting something that was pretty confusing was
when we were showing red light jobs in the top applicant feed. This also happens in the for you feed.
But yeah, we were showing your profile may be missing qualifications, but we're also saying, your top applicant, Charles was saying, I wouldn't actually be a top applicant for that, because it says I may be missing qualifications.
So we need to figure out just how we want to address these red light signals. You know, we need to either honor users expectations and not show red light jobs in these feeds or do a better job of explaining why those jobs are there.
And yeah, overall recommendation, consider qualifications and preferences when we are identifying top applicant jobs.
But we can also remember that preferences are flexible. And, you know, like, like Luke mentioned with the homepage with the sectioned homepage. Some of those sections discovery sections have different pay thresholds than others, and so, you know, there are certain situations where it's
acceptable for us to disregard a preference to a degree. But we must explain ourselves when we do that, so maybe we could take some cues from the discovery sections on homepage and have multiple top choice sections or something. You know where we're
showing or sorry. Not top choice top applicant sections where we're showing, you know top applicant, and then we're showing the the top applicant with,
you know, less less alignment with pay, qualification or something.
Zrps lrps blank canvases, paint a poor picture. I think we're all aware that this problem is happening. But one thing I wanted to point out here was that there was a situation that I found pretty interesting
where one of our job seekers had found a job in his job feed that he thought he had applied to, but it didn't say that he had applied on the job card, so he went to my jobs to see if he had applied to it, and saw that. Oh, he actually hadn't applied to it. And so he tried to go back to his feed to find that job so that he could apply to it, and he couldn't find it. We did eventually find it after we refreshed multiple times.
But it was one of those situations where we're not supporting, refinding rediscovery.
And you know, that could disrupt workflows, and, and, you know, lead to reduced reliance on the homepage and lead to missed opportunities.
So I bring this up not to like harp on another problem with this. But I'm I'm bringing it up as maybe something that we could look to as a potential solution.
our scene. Beacon. I hate our scene, beacon. I'm sorry like it. It's my number one opponent, but it fires way way too early, and it drastically overestimates the number of jobs that are seen on. Indeed. And so not only is it possible that the job seekers may want to see a previously seen job again. It's also possible that they never actually saw the job to begin with.
And so one of the things that I wonder when we're trying to alleviate our Zrp and Lrp issues is if there's some way that we could incorporate more seen jobs into that. You know, including an explainability component but just maybe there's a potential source of of jobs for us there.
Alright. A few minutes left. Profile engagement.
Number one thing about profile engagement is that people do not go to their profile. I won't play this video clip. It's really short. But I just thought it was really funny, because whenever I asked, do you go to your profile? One of our participants just straight up, laughed and said like, no, I I never go to my profile.
And so that's just something that we have to be aware of is profile engagements, location. It's not discoverable. And it's not going to be able to compete with the tools that
do directly advance job seekers, goals and
that means that they're not going to proactively engage with this feature.
And that's.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
54:05
On that one. Just a comment. I think the team just, or is ramping up, or is about to ramp the notifications which should then direct the users to go to profile and see who's viewing them. Right? So I I'm expecting that should change the engagement for this feature.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
54:24
I
think it's possible that more people will go to profile. But this next point, is that once they get there, there's nothing for them to do and so
the
you know, yeah, exactly. If job seekers don't visit their profile, do they care that other people visit their profile? No, they don't, indeed, as in Linkedin they're not necessarily expecting that they're they're being searched for by employers that they actually care about. But you know.
let's say, let's say they do get to their profile engagement we need. There needs to be something there for them to do. We need to provide them with the next step. Otherwise there's still gonna be nothing actionable for them to do on this page. So the recommendation here is we need to offer more next steps. Link to employer pages.
Offer SEO for profile tools to help users diagnose and resolve any performance issues anything like that. Just give them something to be able to actually do on.
Deepti Patibandla
Deepti Patibandla
55:37
I 100% agree with the actionability of it. But I don't agree to the point that, hey? You don't keep visiting your own profile. You actually are curious. Who is seeing you so? Me engaging with my own profile doesn't make sense right. But who else is engaging with my profile? Absolutely right, like, there's a curiosity vector to it.
But I think to your point, how do we make it more meaningful? Is the actionability right? Like, go talk to that person, or go, update this, or go follow their company page. I think we would we should give them some call to action. There.
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
Anita Worthington, Sr. UXR
56:16
Alright. So another thing about that page. Just the a minor issue charts unnecessary. It's distracting from the overall attractiveness of the page and we can really just remove it. To to simplify that page overall and you know, thinking about who's looking at me.
you know, like, like we've like, we've been discussing
participants do see value in knowing that people looked at their profile. But they only really care about employers in which they have a professional interest. And
when people when job seekers were looking at their profile engagement page they weren't seeing a lot of employers that they actually cared about. And so they were wanting to figure out ways for it to for the page to be be less cluttered, and for it to be easier for them to identify employers of interest.
And then last issue on this one
confusing labels. There were a few situations where we were showing. I don't. I'm not sure if this is an advertiser name or not, but it looks like an advertiser name. But yeah, we were. We were showing like Amergus, parent account.
And you know, there, people were saying like, I, I have no idea what that is. What is that? And so I think that's just something for us to investigate. Are we showing an actual company name, or are we showing like a salesforce advertiser. Name. I'm not really sure.
Alright, so we are over time. So
the main thing I just want to call out here for top choice is that people are really really optimistic about top choice. They think it really stands a chance to help them stand out. But it's not unlikely that a job seeker could use all of their top choices and not get a response back.
And so, without proof of impact, they start to grow skeptical and and may disengage with the feature over time. So this is a case where we need to motivate our users to keep engaging.
primarily, we need to.
you know, increase the odds that they will actually hear back from employers. And so it sounds like we're already doing that to an extent. And we can try to figure out ways that we can push that even further. So, partnering really closely with big, easy as they're developing scout to really
figure out ways that we can encourage employers to prioritize these top choice applications and then developing nudges that leverage data claims or loss aversion to encourage job seekers to use their top choice opportunities.
But yeah, that's it. We got through it all lots of great discussion. So thank you so much for participating everyone. But yeah, if anyone has any questions or comments about anything, feel free to reach out. Otherwise I will catch you all next week.

Below is a concise readout of Anita’s feedback from the meeting, organized into three main points:

---

## 1) Challenges Anita Highlighted

### A. Matching & Relevance Issues

- **Pay & Location Mismatch**\
  Users are seeing jobs in both the **Top Applicant** feed and the **For You** feed that fail to honor their stated pay, location, or job-type preferences. In some cases, the pay preference may be ignored or not properly enforced (e.g. showing a $60k salary when the user wants $80k+).
- **Red Light Jobs in Top Applicant**\
  Jobs labeled “You may be missing qualifications” sometimes appear in the “Top Applicant” feed, causing confusion and distrust in the product’s recommendations.

### B. Shallow or Irrelevant Skills Insights

- **Generic Skills (e.g., Microsoft Office)**\
  Common, broad skill tags such as “Microsoft Excel” aren’t helpful or differentiating—especially when the job obviously requires that skill set.
- **Overly Broad Skill Labels**\
  Tags like “coaching,” “sales,” or “acute pain management” (for a sales rep role) confuse job seekers. They either do not provide enough context, or job seekers don’t understand how the skill actually relates to the role.

### C. Disjointed & Non-Actionable Interfaces

- **Applicant Insights & View Job Page**\
  The design feels fragmented. Users have to scroll up and down to cross-reference the main job description with the Applicant Insights skills list.
- **Profile Engagement Page**\
  Many users never visit their profiles, and if they do, there’s not much to do there (“I see that someone viewed my profile, now what?”).
- **Top Applicant vs. Jobs For You Overlap**\
  Even if the exact same jobs do not appear in both feeds, the user perceives them as redundant because both feeds sometimes fail to respect preferences (pay, location) in the same way.

### D. Emotional Impact & Trust

- **Confidence vs. Insecurity**\
  When job seekers feel confident, comparisons to other applicants can be motivating. But when they’re feeling uncertain, being constantly compared to other applicants (“80% of them have X skill”) can magnify self-doubt.
- **Lack of Proof in “Top Choice”**\
  Users want evidence that “Top Choice” really helps them stand out. If they apply to all their top choices and never receive employer responses, they become skeptical and disengage.

---

## 2) Improvements Anita Suggested

### A. Honor User Preferences & Improve Matching

- **Location, Pay, & Scheduling**\
  Top Applicant should factor in a user’s non-negotiables. If a user wants full-time jobs paying $80k+, we should filter (or at least explain why we still show other jobs).
- **Explainability**\
  If we do occasionally show a job that doesn’t match a user’s exact preference (say, $75k instead of $80k), add a short explanation (e.g., “Slightly lower pay than your preference, but you have strong alignment on X skill”).

### B. Surface More Meaningful Skills (Avoid “Noise”)

- **Crow Taxonomy (Crotaxo) Integration**\
  Anita emphasizes that deeper skill tagging (e.g., specifying “High School Football Coaching” vs. just “Coaching”) is crucial. This depends on the new “Crow Taxo” project to improve data quality and specificity.
- **If We Can’t Fix in Time, Simplify**\
  If fully meaningful skill insights aren’t feasible for an upcoming launch, consider removing or downplaying these skill-level insights (while still showing applicant counts, which are valuable).

### C. Refine the “Applicant Insights” & “View Job” Layout

- **Integrated Design**\
  Reduce the disjointed jumps between “applicant insights” at the top and detailed job info further down. Possibly merge these or provide expand/collapse sections for better usability.

### D. Make Profile Engagement Actionable

- **Follow-Up Steps**\
  Give job seekers a way to act on an employer that viewed their profile: e.g., “View open roles,” “Update your profile to highlight X skill,” or “Follow this company.”
- **Simplify Charts & Labels**\
  Busy visuals or “Amergus parent account” labels cause confusion. Use plain employer names and keep charts minimalistic so users can quickly see relevant employer information.

### E. Adjust Pricing or Value Prop (for Premium)

- **If Relevance Remains Unfixed**\
  Consider a price reduction or a shift in messaging, because at present the user might see little difference between the free feed and paid feed.
- **Pro vs. Premium**\
  Pro can still work as a free “beta,” but charging money for the same job recommendations plus shallow skill insights risks eroding trust if we can’t deliver clearly improved results.

---

## 3) How the Product Should Adapt to Anita’s Feedback

1. **Prioritize Accurate Matching & Preference Handling**
   - Investigate any bugs in pay/location filtering—ensure we truly honor user-disclosed preferences.
   - Introduce “explainability” if we slightly deviate from user preferences (e.g., explaining why we’re recommending a job paying $5k less than the user wants).

2. **Enhance Skill Insights or Temporarily Remove Them**
   - Integrate ongoing “Crotaxo” (Crow Taxonomy) improvements to surface specific, job-relevant insights.
   - If robust skill tagging can’t be done soon, **consider removing skill-based Applicant Insights** temporarily—keep only data that users find helpful (like total applicant count).

3. **Refine UI/UX to Promote Cohesion**
   - **Streamline the View Job Page** so that job description details and skill insights appear in one integrated, scannable layout.
   - **Improve Profile Engagement** with actionable next steps: “Contact This Employer,” “See Open Roles,” “Update Your Profile for X,” etc.

4. **Increase Trust & Emotional Resonance**
   - Make “Top Applicant” feed meaningfully different from the standard feed by emphasizing deeper matches and clarifying how (and why) the user stands out.
   - Provide encouraging or constructive guidance when the user is missing a skill (e.g., direct them to an upskilling resource, like Indeed’s “Ace,” “Pathfinder,” or even third-party courses).

5. **Adjust Pricing & Messaging for Premium**
   - If it’s not possible to fix these issues fully before the paid product launch, consider adjusting the price or explicitly stating the product is in “Early Access” with future improvements coming soon.
   - Offer a transitional approach: for example, a discount until “enhanced skill insights” or “improved matching” is fully launched.

---

### Why This Matters

- **User Satisfaction & Retention**\
  If job seekers pay for Premium and experience the same mismatches or shallow insights they get for free, they will likely abandon or churn.
- **Competitive Differentiation**\
  Competitors like LinkedIn already give deeper visibility into skill alignment and applicant pools. We must meet or exceed that standard to justify a premium price.
- **Data Quality & Future ML Projects**\
  Tighter integration with “Crow Taxo” or additional LLM-based skill extraction can significantly improve the depth and accuracy of user insights—making features like “Top Applicant” truly powerful rather than redundant.

By focusing on these key points—matching accuracy, meaningful insight, cohesive UX, and clear value propositions—we can ensure Anita’s feedback is fully addressed and that we move toward a product experience where paid users feel confident about the extra value they’re receiving.
