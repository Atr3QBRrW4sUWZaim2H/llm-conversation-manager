It looks like **systemd** is repeatedly attempting to start the Ollama service (ollama.service) and failing each time with the error:

```
Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?
```

When a service fails this way, systemd tries to restart it (based on its restart policy), but once it hits a certain number of failures in a short interval, systemd gives up and you get the "Start request repeated too quickly" message.

Below are some general troubleshooting and setup tips that often resolve issues like this. You may have already done some steps, but I’ll include them for completeness.

---

## 1. Check the Service Unit File

First, ensure the `ollama.service` unit file is set up correctly. Typically, a systemd service for a server-like application (such as Ollama in server mode) looks something like:

```
[Unit]
Description=Ollama Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
Restart=on-failure
User=ollama
Group=ollama

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Things to check in the service file:

1. **ExecStart** path: Make sure it matches the actual path to the Ollama binary on your system. You can verify by running:
   ```bash
   which ollama
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   command -v ollama
   ```
   If the binary is located in a different directory, update your `ExecStart` accordingly.

2. **User and Group**: If you’re running Ollama as a specific user (e.g., `ollama`), ensure that user exists on the system and has permissions to execute the binary. You might consider running it as `root` or another user for testing, but long-term it’s safer to run as a dedicated non-root user.

3. **Environment variables**: If Ollama requires any environment variables (e.g., model paths, or other config paths) make sure they are set in the service file either via `Environment=` lines or an environment file.

4. **Type=simple**: This is usually fine for an application that runs in the foreground and listens on a port. If Ollama expects a socket or you have some special startup logic, you may need a different Type (e.g., `notify`). But for most typical scenarios, `simple` is correct.

---

## 2. Manually Test the Ollama Serve Command

To isolate whether the problem is with the binary itself or systemd, try running Ollama outside of systemd:

```bash
ollama serve
```

- If the server starts successfully and listens on a port (normally you’d see something like “Server listening on …”), then you know Ollama is functional.
- If you get an immediate error or it fails to bind to a port, that might indicate a port conflict or a missing dependency.

You can also look at the **listening ports** to see if Ollama is running but on the wrong interface or port:

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
```

---

## 3. Inspect Logs in More Detail

You’ve already shared a snippet from the systemd logs. To get more detail:

```bash
# Check status
systemctl status ollama.service

# View detailed logs (if systemd journal is your main logging mechanism)
journalctl -u ollama.service -b

# Or for older logs as well
journalctl -u ollama.service
```

Look for any lines after “Starting Ollama Service…” that hint at why Ollama fails—sometimes you’ll see more detail about what specifically caused it to exit with an error.

---

## 4. Confirm Dependencies and “After” Targets

If Ollama relies on the network stack being fully ready (for example, if it needs a reachable port or an internet connection for something else), you may want to include:

```
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
```

in your `[Unit]` section. This ensures that the systemd service for Ollama doesn’t even try to start until the network is up.

---

## 5. Disable Rapid Restarts for Debugging

When a service fails too quickly and systemd tries to restart it multiple times, you might not get enough time to see its real error messages. Temporarily disabling the restart (by removing or commenting out `Restart=`) can help:

```ini
[Service]
# ...
# Restart=on-failure
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start ollama.service
```

This way, if Ollama fails, it won’t keep auto-restarting, and you can check the logs thoroughly.

---

## 6. Permissions / SELinux / AppArmor Considerations

Depending on your distribution:

- **SELinux** (on Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) or **AppArmor** (on Ubuntu) can sometimes block applications from binding to certain network ports or performing actions outside their policy. You can see if SELinux is in **Enforcing** mode via:
  ```bash
  sestatus
  ```
  and if the logs mention SELinux denials, you may need to adjust or disable SELinux for this service.

- Similarly, if you’re on Ubuntu with **AppArmor**, check if there are any denials in `/var/log/syslog` or use:
  ```bash
  dmesg | grep apparmor
  ```
  to see if AppArmor is blocking your binary.

---

## 7. Additional Ollama-Specific Configuration

Depending on the Ollama version and how you installed it, confirm any custom configuration steps. For instance, you might need to specify model paths or confirm that the default models directory is accessible by the user that runs the systemd service. If you recently installed or built Ollama from source, check that the binary is fully functional with the expected paths.

If Ollama stores or expects data in a particular directory (like `/usr/local/share/ollama` or something similar), confirm the service user has permissions there.

---

## Summary

1. **Check the service file** to make sure it points to the correct Ollama binary and has correct user/group settings.
2. **Run Ollama manually** to ensure it works outside of systemd.
3. **Inspect detailed logs** with `journalctl -u ollama.service` for clues on why Ollama exits.
4. **Adjust systemd dependencies** so the network is ready, if needed.
5. **Disable auto-restart** to more easily capture logs.
6. **Check for SELinux/AppArmor** or other permission issues that can kill processes unexpectedly.
7. **Validate Ollama’s own configurations** (paths, models, environment variables).

With these steps, you should be able to track down why the Ollama service fails to remain active. Typically, it comes down to an incorrect path for the binary, missing permissions, or a mismatch in how the service is started versus how you run it in a regular shell. Once it’s running smoothly, you can re-enable any restart policies (`Restart=on-failure`) to ensure it’s robust against crashes in the future.

---

### Further Exploration

- **Local LLM Hosting**: Since Ollama is a local LLM server, you might find it interesting to explore how it compares to other local inference solutions (like running models through a Python-based server, or using containerized solutions with Docker).
- **Network Services on Linux**: Understanding how systemd organizes dependencies (like `After=`, `Wants=`) can help you with other services (e.g., custom ML services) that might need to wait for hardware initialization (GPUs) or network availability before starting.
- **Security Hardening**: Running LLM services locally can sometimes require large model files. Keeping them in a dedicated directory with the right permissions (and controlling which users can run them) can be part of a more robust DevOps approach.

Hopefully these suggestions help you pinpoint the cause of the repeated restart failures and get Ollama up and running smoothly! If you run into specific errors beyond the “could not connect” message, feel free to share them for more targeted help.

Based on the systemd unit file you shared, here are some things to check and try. Often, a small detail in the service file or environment causes the repeated “could not connect” error. Let’s walk through some suggestions step by step.

---

## 1. Verify Ollama Works Manually

Before debugging systemd, confirm that Ollama works as expected **outside** of systemd when run by the same user (“ashwin”):

1. **Switch to user “ashwin”** (if not already):
   ```bash
   sudo su - ashwin
   ```
2. **Pull the model** (if not already cached):
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   ```
3. **Start the server** manually:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0:11434
   ```
4. **Check if it’s listening**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i -P -n | grep 11434
   ```
   or try to **curl** it from the same machine:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434
   ```

If everything runs fine in a normal shell, then at least the binary and model pulling steps are good. If it fails or produces an error, note what’s happening. That will help narrow down if there’s a missing dependency or a permissions issue.

---

## 2. Look at the Detailed Logs

Sometimes the snippet you see in `systemctl status ollama.service` or `journalctl -u ollama.service` can be abbreviated. To get more detail:

```bash
journalctl -u ollama.service -b
```

Or (to follow logs in real-time as you start it):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ollama.service
sudo journalctl -u ollama.service -f
```

Open another terminal and do:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ollama.service
```

Watch for any error lines beyond `Error: could not connect to ollama app`. There may be lines from the ExecStartPre step (`ollama pull llama3.2:1b`) indicating a failure.

---

## 3. Potential ExecStartPre Issues

Your service file uses:

```ini
ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
```

- **Check if the model is already cached.** If the `pull` step fails for any reason (e.g., no internet, permission issues, out of disk space), systemd will mark the service as failed and won’t proceed to ExecStart.

- **Time to pull**: Large model files can take a while to download. If there’s a time limit or an unstable connection, the pull might fail. You can manually pull the model once (as above in Step 1), remove the `ExecStartPre` line, and see if that helps.
  ```ini
  #ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
  ```
  Then do:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart ollama.service
  ```

If removing `ExecStartPre` makes the service stay up, the pull step may have been the culprit.

---

## 4. Confirm Systemd Environment Handling

Systemd merges `Environment=` lines before starting the process, so the order of `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=..."` vs. `ExecStart` generally isn’t an issue. But you could also **inline** the host in `ExecStart` to be certain:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0:11434
```

(This often makes logs more direct if something about the host or port is invalid.)

---

## 5. Permissions and Ownership

Because you’re running as `User=ashwin`, verify:

- **File permissions**:
  ```bash
  ls -l /usr/local/bin/ollama
  ```
  Make sure it’s executable by user `ashwin`. Typically, you’d see something like `-rwxr-xr-x root root ... /usr/local/bin/ollama`, which means everyone can execute it.

- **Model directory**: The user `ashwin` needs read/write access to wherever Ollama places or pulls the model files. If by default it’s writing to `~/.ollama`, then the `HOME=/home/ashwin` environment is good; just be certain that directory has correct ownership:

  ```bash
  ls -ld /home/ashwin/.ollama
  ```

  (Should be owned by `ashwin:ashwin` or have appropriate permissions.)

- **Group**: If your distribution has a default group for `ashwin`, systemd will automatically use that. In some edge cases, you might need `Group=ashwin` in the `[Service]` section, but usually `User=ashwin` is enough.

---

## 6. Check for Network or SELinux/AppArmor

- **Port**: `11434` is above 1024, so you don’t need special privileges to bind it. If it’s already in use, Ollama would fail to start. Check with:
  ```bash
  sudo lsof -i :11434
  ```
- **SELinux/AppArmor**: On Ubuntu, AppArmor might block execution if the profile is strict. Check `dmesg | grep apparmor` or `sudo journalctl -xe` for lines referencing `DENIED`. If you see them, you might need to create or adjust an AppArmor profile.

---

## 7. Try Disabling Auto-Restart Temporarily

To debug more easily (so it doesn’t keep retrying and cutting off the logs), comment out `Restart=on-failure`:

```ini
[Service]
# ...
# Restart=on-failure
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start ollama.service
```

Now you can see the **exact** reason it fails in the logs without repeated restarts.

---

## 8. Summarize the Main Checks

1. **Manual test** under the same user (`ashwin`).
2. **Remove ExecStartPre** and see if the service stays alive (maybe the pull fails).
3. **Check logs** with `journalctl -u ollama.service -b` for more specifics.
4. **Ensure permissions** on `/usr/local/bin/ollama` and the model directory are correct.
5. **Inline the host** in the ExecStart command if environment variable usage is in question.
6. **Look for SELinux/AppArmor** denials on Ubuntu.

With these steps, you should pinpoint why systemd says “could not connect to ollama app.” Commonly, it’s either:

- the `ExecStartPre` is failing,
- a permission issue in the user environment,
- or a missing/broken model pull that kills the startup process.

Once you have it stable, you can re-enable the model pull if you need it on each startup or just rely on having the model cached already.

---

### Further Tips

Since you’re working with local language models:

- **Model Storage**: Large models can consume significant disk space. Consider storing them on a dedicated partition or in a well-documented location (e.g., `/opt/ollama/models`) with the correct user permissions.
- **Systemd Hardening**: If you keep this service in production, you can add lines like `ProtectSystem=full`, `NoNewPrivileges=true`, etc., to your `[Service]` block for additional security.
- **GPU vs. CPU**: If Ollama or your distribution might use GPU acceleration, ensure the user can access GPU drivers (if relevant).

By systematically going through these checks, you should be able to make Ollama start reliably under systemd. Good luck, and feel free to share any new error messages from your logs if you get stuck!

<time datetime="2025-01-24T03:15:07.371Z" title="1/24/2025, 12:15:07 PM">12:15</time>

The key issue here is that **`ollama pull` now requires a running Ollama server** to connect to, and your systemd service is trying to run the pull command before the server is up. As a result, `ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b` fails with:

> Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?

So systemd never gets past `ExecStartPre` to actually start the server.

---

## Why This Happens

In recent Ollama releases (as of around 0.5.x), most CLI subcommands—including `pull`—attempt to contact a background Ollama server (an “always on” daemon) rather than doing everything offline. If that server isn’t already running, the CLI errors out with “Error: could not connect to ollama app.”

When systemd tries `ExecStartPre=ollama pull ...`, there’s no Ollama server running yet, so it instantly fails. Since `ExecStartPre` must succeed for `ExecStart` to run, your service never starts `ollama serve`.

---

## Two Ways to Fix

### 1. Remove the `ExecStartPre` Pull Step

If you already pulled the model manually, or if you prefer to do so separately, you can simply remove the `ExecStartPre` line. For example:

```ini
[Service]
User=ashwin
Environment="HOME=/home/ashwin"
# Remove or comment out the pull line:
# ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b

ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
Restart=on-failure
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start ollama.service
```

Since you’ve already manually tested `ollama serve` and verified it works (listening on 127.0.0.1:11434), the service should now remain active under systemd.

---

### 2. Run a Background Ollama Server First

If you really want systemd to **pull the model automatically** at startup, you’d have to ensure Ollama is running before you call `ollama pull`. That typically means:

1. Splitting the service into two separate units—one for a “background” Ollama server (which must be up), and another that does the pull.
2. Or having the server start in the background from the CLI, which might not be supported by your current version.

Since that’s more complicated and still in flux with newer Ollama CLI changes, **the simplest approach is to remove `ExecStartPre`** and pull your models manually or via a separate script once the server is up.

---

## Verifying Ollama Serve

1. **Manual Pull** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Start or verify an Ollama server is running in another terminal...
   ollama serve &

   # Then pull the model:
   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   ```
   or if your version doesn’t require the server for pulling (older versions), just do `ollama pull llama3.2:1b`.

2. **Check that the model is cached**:
   - By default, in `~/.ollama/models` (or wherever `OLLAMA_MODELS` points).
   - `ollama list` can show available images/models.

3. **Run under Systemd**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now ollama.service
   ```
   Now it should say `Active: active (running)` instead of failing.

---

## Confirming All is Well

- **`systemctl status ollama.service`** should show “active (running)”.
- **`journalctl -u ollama.service`** should have no more “could not connect” errors.
- **`curl http://127.0.0.1:11434`** (or `curl http://localhost:11434`) should return “Ollama is running”.

At that point, you can use your local Ollama server normally—generating completions, embedding text, or pulling new models as needed.

---

### In Summary

- **Remove the ExecStartPre pull line**: That step fails because your version of Ollama needs the server running first.
- **Pull the model manually or after the server is up**: Now your systemd service should successfully start Ollama and stay active.

This resolves the “Error: could not connect to ollama app” loop and the repeated systemd restart failures.

<time datetime="2025-01-24T03:19:04.475Z" title="1/24/2025, 12:19:04 PM">12:19</time>

From the logs, there are **two main problems** causing your systemd service to fail:

1. **Older Ollama version** that does not accept the `--host` flag.
2. **`ExecStartPre=ollama pull` used to require (in recent versions) the Ollama app already running,** but in your older version, or with the current behavior, it may also not work as you expect.

Currently, your logs repeatedly show:

```
Error: unknown flag: --host
```

and also:

```
Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?
```

Below is how you can fix or work around these issues.

---

## 1) Remove Any `--host` Flag References

Your systemd logs explicitly say:

```
Error: unknown flag: --host
```

But your more recent unit file snippets don’t show `--host`. This suggests:

- You either still have a systemd unit somewhere else that uses `--host`, or
- Systemd is using a **cached** or **older** unit file.

### How to fix:

1. **Check all versions of your `ollama.service`** to ensure none of them include `--host` anywhere.
   - Look in `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service` and make sure:
     ```ini
     ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
     ```
     is just that—**no** extra flags.
   - Also remove or comment out any environment variable lines referencing `OLLAMA_HOST=...` if your older Ollama build doesn’t support binding to 0.0.0.0.

2. **Reload systemd** to be sure it sees your changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Re-check your running service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start ollama.service
   sudo systemctl status ollama.service
   ```
   If systemd fails again with `unknown flag: --host`, it means there’s still an old file or old config line somewhere.

*(**Tip**: Make sure you don’t have another unit like `/lib/systemd/system/ollama.service` overshadowing `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`. You can run `systemd-analyze unit-paths` to see all possible locations.)*

---

## 2) Remove or Modify the `ExecStartPre=ollama pull` Step

In newer Ollama releases (0.5.x+), the `pull` command tries to contact a background daemon. In your logs, that fails if Ollama is **not** already running.

But from your latest log snippet:

```
Process: 2052593 ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
Process: 2052630 ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
```

It looks like `ollama pull` may have succeeded this time, so it might no longer be the culprit. Instead, the actual **serve** command is crashing with status=1.

**However**, if you are mixing older/newer builds, or if the pull eventually tries to contact an unreachable daemon, you could still see the “could not connect to ollama app” error.

### Quick solution:

- **Comment out or remove** the `ExecStartPre` line:
  ```ini
  [Service]
  # ...
  # ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
  # ...
  ```
- Manually pull your model once (outside systemd) if needed.

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ollama.service
```

---

## 3) Confirm You’re Actually Running the Same Ollama Build Everywhere

You discovered that if you run `/usr/local/bin/ollama serve` **manually**, it listens at `127.0.0.1:11434` and works fine:

```bash
ollama serve
# ...
# Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434
```

That’s good. Yet systemd’s logs show a mismatch—`unknown flag: --host`—which indicates a **different** binary or older build might be invoked under systemd.

Possible causes:

- You replaced the Ollama binary without fully removing the old one.
- There is another binary in your `$PATH` that takes precedence when run as `root` (via systemd).
- The systemd unit might be referencing a symlink or old path.

**What to do**:

1. Verify exactly **which** binary systemd is calling:
   ```bash
   file /usr/local/bin/ollama
   ls -l /usr/local/bin/ollama
   ```
2. Check permissions and ownership. Make sure it’s executable by all and that `ashwin` can run it:
   ```bash
   ls -l /usr/local/bin/ollama
   ```
3. As root (the same environment systemd uses), see if `which ollama` yields the same path:
   ```bash
   sudo su -
   which ollama
   exit
   ```
4. Possibly do:
   ```bash
   strings /usr/local/bin/ollama | grep -i version
   ```
   to see if it matches the version you run manually.

If you find two different installs, remove or rename the old one so only one valid binary remains.

---

## 4) If You Want to Bind to `0.0.0.0`…

It looks like your Ollama version 0.5.7 (from the logs) doesn’t support `ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0:11434` as a flag, but it **does** read environment variables. However, you noticed it sets `Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434` anyway.

- Some older builds interpret the environment variable `OLLAMA_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:11434` or `0.0.0.0:11434`.
- Some do not properly parse it and fall back to 127.0.0.1.

Try setting the environment variable in your shell like this (before starting serve) to see if it truly listens on 0.0.0.0:

```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434
ollama serve
```

Then from another machine on your network, try connecting to `<server-ip>:11434`. If it fails, it means your build simply doesn’t bind to 0.0.0.0 or is ignoring that variable.

---

## Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Remove or comment out** any line with `--host` in your systemd unit. That flag doesn’t exist in your build.

2. **Remove** (or comment) the `ExecStartPre=ollama pull llama3.2:1b` if it’s not needed.

3. **Ensure** your systemd unit is now effectively:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Ollama Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=ashwin
   Environment="HOME=/home/ashwin"
   # Possibly remove or comment out the next line if your older build won't parse it:
   # Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
   # ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
   Restart=on-failure

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

4. **Reload and restart**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now ollama.service
   sudo systemctl status ollama.service
   ```

5. If you want the model automatically pulled **once** the server is up, do so in a **separate** script or unit. Otherwise, do it manually:
   ```bash
   ollama serve &    # or run via systemd
   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   ```

6. If it still fails, check logs again:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u ollama.service -f
   ```
   The key is verifying it isn’t complaining about “unknown flag” or “could not connect.”

---

## 5) Once It’s Running

- **Confirm** by `curl http://127.0.0.1:11434` from the server itself.
- If you need remote access, confirm you can connect from another machine to `<your-server-ip>:11434`. If it doesn’t respond, your Ollama version might only bind to 127.0.0.1.

After these adjustments, Ollama should remain up and running under systemd without the “unknown flag: --host” or “could not connect” errors.

From the logs and commands you’ve shared, there are **two main issues** causing the repeated failures:

1. **A prior Ollama instance is already listening on port 11434** when you manually run `ollama serve`. This prevents the systemd instance from binding the same port.
2. **Older versions or certain recent builds of Ollama do not accept the `--host` flag.** The error `Error: unknown flag: --host` appears in your logs when the systemd unit attempts to run Ollama with that flag.

Below is a step-by-step guide to get Ollama working reliably as a systemd service without these conflicts.

---

## 1. Stop Any Manually-Run Ollama Process

When you run `ollama serve` in your shell, it binds to port 11434 and keeps running. Meanwhile, systemd’s Ollama service tries to bind the same port, which typically causes a failure (though sometimes the error is hidden). To fix:

1. **Stop your manual instance**
   - Either press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it’s running, or
   - Find and kill the process:

     ```bash
     ps aux | grep ollama
     kill <pid>
     ```

2. **Verify the port is free**

   ```bash
   lsof -i -P -n | grep 11434
   ```

   The above command should show **no output** if nothing is listening on that port.

---

## 2. Remove or Fix Any `--host` Flag in Your Systemd Unit

Your older Ollama logs clearly showed:

```
Error: unknown flag: --host
```

So if you still have a line in the `[Service]` section like:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve --host 0.0.0.0:11434
```

…remove the `--host 0.0.0.0:11434` part. **Most recent Ollama CLI builds** (0.5.x and above) read the host/port from the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable rather than a CLI flag. Your final `[Service]` might look like:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Ollama Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ashwin
Environment="HOME=/home/ashwin"
# If your Ollama version still needs an offline pull, either remove it or confirm it works offline:
# ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
# Set environment variable for the host/port:
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ollama.service
```

Check the status:

```bash
systemctl status ollama.service
```

---

## 3. Confirm the Ollama Version

Because the behavior of `ollama serve` and `ollama pull` can differ by version, it’s worth ensuring you’re on a recent release. You can check with:

```bash
ollama version
```

- If you see a version older than something like **0.5.x**—or if the `--host` flag truly doesn’t exist—you may want to **upgrade**.
- On Linux, re-run:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
  ```

  Then verify:

  ```bash
  which ollama
  ollama version
  ```

Make sure you’re calling the updated binary (not an older one in a different folder).

---

## 4. (Optional) Remove `ExecStartPre` if Pull Fails

In newer Ollama versions, `ollama pull <model>` tries to talk to a running Ollama server. If the server is not up yet, that pull command fails. If your systemd unit includes:

```ini
ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

…that often fails in a **fresh** boot scenario. Common solutions:

1. **Remove** the `ExecStartPre` line and do the pull manually (once) so the model is cached:
   ```bash
   ollama serve &  # or run systemd service in one terminal
   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   kill %1          # if you started it in the background
   ```
   Then the systemd service can start the server without needing to pull every time.

2. **If you’re on an older Ollama that supports offline pulls** (rare in 0.5.x and above), the `pull` might work **before** `serve`. But in most new builds, it’s blocked unless the server is running. Hence, the best route is manual or a separate script after the server is up.

---

## 5. Verify Successful Startup

Once you’ve removed conflicting flags and made sure no manual Ollama instance is blocking port 11434:

1. **Start the service**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now ollama.service
   ```

2. **Check if it’s active**
   ```bash
   systemctl status ollama.service
   # or
   journalctl -u ollama.service -b
   ```
   You want to see `Active: active (running)`.

3. **Test from the same machine**
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:11434
   # or
   curl http://0.0.0.0:11434
   ```
   If you set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` in the environment, it should say “Ollama is running” in the response.

---

## 6. Upgrading for Full Host Support

If you do want to run Ollama on **all network interfaces** (i.e. `0.0.0.0`), the environment variable approach is correct. For version **0.5.7 and newer**:

- Set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` in your systemd service file.
- Confirm after startup that the logs say something like “Listening on 0.0.0.0:11434.”

If you see it still binding to `127.0.0.1:11434`, it means there’s an **older** environment override or a version mismatch. Double-check with:

```bash
systemctl cat ollama.service
ollama version
which ollama
```

And look for references to older configurations or older paths.

---

## 7. Summary

1. **Stop the manually run Ollama** so it doesn’t occupy port 11434.
2. **Remove any `--host` flags** from systemd, since your Ollama binary doesn’t recognize them.
3. **Use the environment variable** `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` to listen externally.
4. **Remove or comment out `ExecStartPre=ollama pull ...`** if it fails without the server running.
5. **Upgrade** if you have an older Ollama version lacking environment variable support or offline pulls.
6. **Reload systemd** and **start the service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now ollama.service
   ```
   Then verify everything is good with `systemctl status ollama.service` and a quick `curl http://localhost:11434`.

Following the above steps should get Ollama running smoothly as a systemd service on your Ubuntu system. Once it’s up, you can further tweak environment variables (like GPU support or keep-alive options) or confirm that you’re exposing it on the network properly if you want to access it from other machines.

Great news—your **systemd service is now active** and running Ollama successfully! That means you’ve resolved the earlier conflicts (`--host` flag errors, etc.). Here are a few clarifications and next steps based on what you’re seeing:

---

## 1. Ollama is Running via Systemd

The output:

```
● ollama.service - Ollama Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running)
   Main PID: 2060302 (ollama)
```

confirms that your Ollama server is up and running under systemd. The repeated failure messages are gone, which is a big step forward.

---

## 2. “Unknown command ‘version’ for ‘ollama’”

When you ran:

```
ollama version
```

you got:

```
Error: unknown command "version" for "ollama"
```

This simply means you’re using a **slightly older or custom build** of Ollama that doesn’t include a `version` subcommand. Different Ollama builds have had different CLI features over time:

- **Newer versions** (e.g., 0.5.x and above) typically support `ollama version`.
- **Older versions** might not.

If you want to **upgrade** to a more recent version that supports `ollama version`, you can do so with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
which ollama
ollama --help
```

Then confirm if the new binary has the subcommand you need.

*(Be sure you don’t have multiple Ollama binaries in different locations—sometimes an old one in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` can overshadow a newer one.)*

---

## 3. Confirming It Listens on 0.0.0.0

Your systemd file includes:

```ini
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434"
```

To verify Ollama is actually binding to `0.0.0.0` (not just `127.0.0.1`), you can:

1. **Check open ports**:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep 11434
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 11434
   ```
   If it says `LISTEN  0.0.0.0:11434`, it means Ollama is indeed on all interfaces.

2. **Try reaching it from another machine** on the same network:
   ```bash
   curl http://<your-ubuntu-server-ip>:11434
   ```
   You should see the “Ollama is running” message if your firewall or security group isn’t blocking it.

In your logs (systemctl status), you’ll see a truncated line like:

```
"Listening ...
```

Right after `Listening on ` it might show `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`. If it still says `127.0.0.1`, you’re effectively binding only to localhost despite the environment variable. That can happen with older versions which don’t fully parse `OLLAMA_HOST`. Upgrading might fix it.

---

## 4. Optional: Remove or Disable the `ExecStartPre=pull` Step

You mentioned (or commented out) this line in your service:

```ini
ExecStartPre=/usr/local/bin/ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

In **newer** Ollama releases, `ollama pull <model>` attempts to contact a running Ollama daemon. If there’s no daemon yet (like in a fresh systemd startup), the pull fails. Usually, you can just manually pull your model once. Example:

```bash
# If you want to store a model locally:
ollama serve &            # start a local instance in background
ollama pull llama3.2:1b   # pulls the model
kill %1                   # kill background server
```

Then your systemd service can just do `ollama serve` without needing to pull each time.

---

## 5. Verifying Everything’s Good

- **Systemd is “active (running)”** ✔
- You can **curl** the server locally at `127.0.0.1:11434` or `localhost:11434`.
- If you configured it for `0.0.0.0:11434`, test from another machine in your LAN:
  ```bash
  curl http://<LAN IP>:11434
  ```
- **No more repeated restarts** or “unknown flag: --host” errors.

If all that works, your local Ollama service is set up and stable. You can keep an eye on logs with:

```bash
journalctl -u ollama.service -f
```

to monitor requests or any unexpected errors.

---

### In Summary

- **You’re successfully running Ollama under systemd** now.
- The `version` subcommand error means your build predates that feature—upgrade if you want that functionality.
- **Confirm** that `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434` is respected if you need external access; older builds might ignore it.
- If everything’s fine, you’re good to go using your local Ollama LLM! Enjoy generating text or embeddings right from your own server.
