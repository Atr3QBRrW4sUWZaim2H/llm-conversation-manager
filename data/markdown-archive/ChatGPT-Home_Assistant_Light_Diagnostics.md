This script is essentially a **diagnostic and reporting tool** for your Home Assistant light entities, with a particular focus on **Adaptive Lighting** configuration and **capability checks**. Here’s a high-level breakdown of what it does:

1. **Retrieves a list of all light entities** from Home Assistant by querying:
   ```
   http://localhost:8123/api/states
   ```
   It filters entities whose `entity_id` starts with `"light."`.

2. **Groups lights by capability** using the `'supported_color_modes'` attribute. It creates three groups:
   - **Color Temperature** (lights that can change color temperature)
   - **Brightness Only** (lights that only support brightness adjustment)
   - **Other** (any remaining lights with different or unknown capabilities)

3. **Analyzes the current state** of each group of lights:
   - Fetches and prints the state of an associated **Adaptive Lighting switch** (for example, `switch.adaptive_lighting_color_temperature` if the group name is `"Color Temperature"`).
   - Checks each light to see if it supports the modes and features that the Adaptive Lighting configuration is trying to apply (e.g., color temperature, brightness).
     - If a light doesn’t support color temperature but Adaptive Lighting is sending those commands, the script prints a **capability warning**.
   - Collects **brightness statistics** (min, max, average brightness) for lights that are `on`.
   - Prints a detailed listing of each light’s **status** (on/off, brightness percentage, color temperature in Kelvin or mired, etc.) and **capabilities** (`supported_color_modes`, `min_color_temp_kelvin`, `max_color_temp_kelvin`, etc.).

4. **Prints a summary** of:
   - Any **capability warnings** encountered.
   - **Brightness statistics** across all lights in a group (minimum, maximum, average brightness).
   - The **capability-based groupings** so you can see which lights share the same color/brightness modes.

---

### How it Works with Home Assistant

- **Home Assistant Token**: The script uses a long-lived access token stored in an environment variable `HA_TOKEN`. This token is added to the header (`"Authorization": TOKEN`) for the REST calls.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/states` returns the state of all entities in Home Assistant.
  - `GET /api/states/{entity_id}` returns the specific state for a given entity (e.g., `light.kitchen`).
- **Adaptive Lighting**: The script looks for a switch named `switch.adaptive_lighting_<group_name>` to get **Adaptive Lighting** settings, which typically manage **brightness** and **color temperature** throughout the day.

---

### Why This Script is Useful

- **Diagnostics**: If you have multiple types of light bulbs (e.g., different brands or models), you may have encountered issues where some bulbs don’t respond as expected to Adaptive Lighting. This script helps **pinpoint mismatch** between what Adaptive Lighting is trying to set and what each light supports.
- **Configuration Insight**: It gives a concise overview of brightness levels and color temperatures across all your lights at a glance, which helps in fine-tuning your **Home Assistant** or **Adaptive Lighting** setup.
- **Automated Reporting**: It can be run periodically (e.g., via a cron job or scheduled task in a Docker container) to generate a **snapshot** of your lighting environment—especially valuable if you’re troubleshooting or verifying changes in your setup.

---

### Key Concepts & Terminologies in Home Automation

- **Entity & Entity State**: In Home Assistant, each device or virtual device is an “entity.” Its “state” describes attributes such as on/off status, brightness, color temperature, etc.
- **Adaptive Lighting**: A popular integration in Home Assistant that automatically adjusts your lights’ brightness and color temperature based on the time of day, aiming to mimic natural light patterns.
- **Color Temperature (Kelvin / Mired)**:
  - **Kelvin** (K) is a measure of the color temperature used in many lighting systems.
  - **Mired** is an alternative inverse scale that some bulbs and integrators use (`mired = 1,000,000 / Kelvin`).
- **RESTful API**: Home Assistant exposes a REST API for reading and writing entity states. This script makes GET requests to retrieve states.

---

### Potential Next Steps or Enhancements

- **Write Capability**: Currently, the script only reads states. You could expand it to **adjust lights** or **toggle** the Adaptive Lighting switch if certain conditions are met.
- **Logging & Alerts**: Instead of printing warnings to the console, integrate with a logging system or send alerts (e.g., push notifications) when mismatched capabilities are detected.
- **Templating**: Use a templating library (like Jinja2) or Home Assistant’s built-in templating to generate richer reports.
- **Integration with Docker**: If you’re running Home Assistant inside Docker, ensure the container can access `localhost:8123` or adjust the URL accordingly (e.g., use the container name or host IP).

---

Overall, this script gives you a **snapshot** of your Home Assistant lights, checks whether they align with your Adaptive Lighting settings, and summarizes important brightness and color temperature information. If you’re exploring **IoT** and **home automation** concepts, it’s a nice example of **RESTful API** usage, **capability discovery**, and **automated diagnostics** for an integrated smart home setup.

requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL 'light.300w_landscape_light': No scheme supplied. Perhaps you meant https://light.300w_landscape_light?
```

happens because `get_entity_state(entity_id)` is constructing an invalid URL. In your snippet, that function uses:

```python
url = "	" + entity_id
```

which produces something like `"    light.300w_landscape_light"`—not a valid URI since it has no `http://` or `https://` and no base domain.

---

## How to Fix It

You need the Home Assistant API endpoint plus `/api/states/` in front of the entity ID. If you’re using the Nabu Casa remote URL, do something like this in `get_entity_state`:

```python
def get_entity_state(entity_id):
    base_url = "https://<your_nabu_casa_subdomain>.ui.nabu.casa"  # e.g. "https://e3i31imcp219zqfqwt4wou4faizmaimh.ui.nabu.casa"
    url = f"{base_url}/api/states/{entity_id}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": TOKEN,  # e.g. "Bearer <your_long_lived_token>"
        "content-type": "application/json",
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Error getting state for {entity_id}: {response.status_code}")
        return None
```

Make sure `base_url` matches whichever domain or local IP/port you’re using to access Home Assistant. For example, if you’re accessing Home Assistant locally at `http://localhost:8123`, change it to:

```python
base_url = "http://localhost:8123"
```

Also confirm that your token is correct (you can keep it in an environment variable or directly in the code as `"Bearer <token>"`).

---

## Why This Error Occurs

- **Missing scheme**: The Python `requests` library requires a full URL with `http://` or `https://`. Simply concatenating `"light.300w_landscape_light"` doesn’t specify a protocol or domain, so `requests` doesn’t know where to send the request.
- **Originally**: The script needed a URL like `http://localhost:8123/api/states/light.300w_landscape_light` or your Nabu Casa remote link.

---

## Additional Tips

1. **Keep Tokens Secure**: Storing tokens directly in code can be risky. You might want to revert to using `os.getenv("HA_TOKEN")` or a `.env`/secret file if you plan to share or push this code anywhere.
2. **Local vs. Remote**: If you use Nabu Casa (`.ui.nabu.casa`), make sure your `base_url` has `https://`. If Home Assistant is on your LAN, `http://<ip>:8123` might be faster and not dependent on internet.
3. **Check Entities**: The script loops over every `light.` entity and tries to pull its state. If you see a lot of lights (`Found 113 lights in total`), ensure they are all valid in your setup (sometimes old or leftover entities can cause confusion).

Once you fix the `url` in `get_entity_state`, the script should correctly retrieve each light’s state through your Home Assistant instance.

From this output, the script **is successfully grouping your lights** and retrieving states, but you see a few quirks in the logs:

1. **404 Errors & “Adaptive Lighting Switch: Not found”**

   - Each section tries to look up a switch entity called `switch.adaptive_lighting_{group_name}`, where `group_name` is converted to lowercase.
   - For example, with the group `"Color Temperature"`, the code looks for:
     ```
     switch.adaptive_lighting_color temperature
     ```
     which is not a valid entity name in Home Assistant.
   - Similarly, `"Brightness Only"` becomes `switch.adaptive_lighting_brightness only`.
   - Since those exact switch entities don’t exist in your system, Home Assistant returns 404. If you don’t actually have separate “Color Temperature” or “Brightness Only” Adaptive Lighting switches, these errors are harmless. They just tell you there’s no such entity.

   **How to fix**:

   - Either **ignore** these if you don’t use multiple Adaptive Lighting switches.
   - Or **rename** your groups so they match actual switch entities in Home Assistant. For instance, if you have a switch named `switch.adaptive_lighting_color_temp`, you’d change the group to `"Color_Temp"` so it looks up `switch.adaptive_lighting_color_temp` instead of `switch.adaptive_lighting_color temperature`.

2. **“temp: NoneK” Entries**

   - You’ll notice some lights show `temp: NoneK`. That happens when the script expects a `color_temp_kelvin` attribute but finds it is either `None` or missing.
   - This is not necessarily an error—some lights (especially certain LED strips or RGB-based bulbs) may internally use `color_temp` in **mired** units or only have an **RGB** color mode. If the bulb doesn’t expose `color_temp_kelvin`, the script has nothing to display and defaults to “NoneK.”

   **How to address**:

   - Verify whether those lights truly support color temperature in Kelvin. Some only offer `color_temp` in mireds (e.g., `color_temp: 153` to 500).
   - If the attribute is just missing, the script can’t convert it to Kelvin, so you see `NoneK`.
   - You could modify the script to check for `color_temp` first, then convert mireds to Kelvin if you want a consistent “Kelvin-based” display (e.g., `kelvin = 1,000,000 / mired`).

3. **Everything Else is Working Fine**
   - You can see the script prints out which lights are `ON` vs. `OFF`, calculates **min/max/average brightness**, and enumerates each group’s **capabilities** (e.g., `modes:['color_temp', 'rgb']`, `features:44`, etc.).
   - It’s successfully grouping lights into:
     - “Color Temperature”
     - “Brightness Only”
     - “Other”
   - That grouping is based on the `'supported_color_modes'` attribute. For instance:
     - If `'color_temp'` is in `supported_color_modes`, it goes into “Color Temperature.”
     - If `'brightness'` is in `supported_color_modes` (and not `color_temp`), it goes to “Brightness Only.”
     - Otherwise, “Other.”

---

### Summarizing Next Steps

1. **Ignore the 404 if you don’t have matching `switch.adaptive_lighting_*` entities**\
   The script tries to query them but they don’t exist in your configuration. That’s expected behavior if you only have one default adaptive lighting switch or none at all.

2. **Rename Groups or Switches**\
   If you do have Adaptive Lighting switches for each group, ensure the group’s name matches the suffix of your actual switch entity. For example, if you have `switch.adaptive_lighting_color_temp`, call your group `"Color_Temp"` so it tries `switch.adaptive_lighting_color_temp` instead of `switch.adaptive_lighting_color temperature`.

3. **No Real Errors**\
   Aside from the mismatch with Adaptive Lighting switch names, there’s no functional issue. Your brightness statistics, light states, and capabilities are being reported as intended.

4. **Optional: Improve `temp: NoneK`**
   - If the lights truly do not expose a Kelvin value, `NoneK` is simply how the script indicates it can’t show color temperature in Kelvin.
   - You could adapt the code to detect `color_temp` (mired) and convert to Kelvin, or just leave it as-is if you only wanted brightness data.

Overall, the script is **doing what it’s meant to**—reporting on your Home Assistant lights, grouping them by capability, and providing a snapshot of their states. The 404 “not found” messages simply mean it couldn’t find a matching Adaptive Lighting switch entity for those group names, which is normal if you haven’t set those switches up or if you named them differently in Home Assistant.

Below is one way to update your YAML automation so that **`light.deck_bedroom_deck`** stays off at the specified time. The key change is **removing** `light.deck_bedroom_deck` from the second “turn\_on” step, so it does not get dimmed with everything else:

```yaml
- conditions:
    - condition: time
      after: "20:00:00"
      before: "23:59:59"
  sequence:
    # 1) Turn OFF the bedroom deck light
    - target:
        entity_id:
          - light.deck_bedroom_deck
      action: light.turn_off
      data: {}

    # 2) Dim the other exterior lights to 15%
    - target:
        entity_id:
          - light.300w_landscape_light
          - light.deck_living_room_deck
          # Removed 'light.deck_bedroom_deck' here to keep it off
          - light.deck_perimeter_lights
          - light.deck_sconces
          - light.courtyard_sconces
          - light.exterior_back_porch_lights
          - light.exterior_deck_lights
          - light.exterior_garage_exterior_lights
          - light.exterior_sconces
          - light.fire_pit_string_lights
      data:
        brightness_pct: 15
      action: light.turn_on
```

### How It Works

1. **First Step**:\
   Uses `light.turn_off` on `light.deck_bedroom_deck` to explicitly turn that particular light **off** at or after 20:00.

2. **Second Step**:\
   Uses `light.turn_on` on all the other listed exterior lights (removing `light.deck_bedroom_deck` from the list) with `brightness_pct: 15`. This dims them without touching the `deck_bedroom_deck` light that was already turned off.

By ensuring `light.deck_bedroom_deck` is **not** in the second step’s `entity_id:` list, it remains off while the other lights are dimmed.

One key issue is that your **time pattern trigger** syntax is incorrect. In Home Assistant automations, the **`trigger:`** key should be **`platform:`** when defining a time pattern. Right now, you have:

```yaml
triggers:
  - minutes: /1
    trigger: time_pattern
```

Instead, it needs to be:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/1"
```

Here’s how your automation could look with the corrected syntax:

```yaml
alias: Exterior Lights
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/1"
conditions: []
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: time

### Why This Matters

- **`platform: time_pattern`** is the correct field name in Home Assistant YAML for scheduling by repeating intervals (e.g., “every minute”).
- If you leave it as **`trigger: time_pattern`**, Home Assistant won’t recognize it as a valid trigger and simply won’t run the automation.

With this fix, your automation should trigger every minute (due to `minutes: "/1"`) and then evaluate the “choose” branches to set your lights as desired based on time of day.
