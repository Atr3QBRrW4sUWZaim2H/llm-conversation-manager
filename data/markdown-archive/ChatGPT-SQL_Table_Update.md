Below is one way to update the existing `crawl_results` table by adding the specified columns. You can run each statement one by one or combine the `ALTER TABLE` steps together. This approach uses `IF NOT EXISTS` so it won’t throw errors if a column has already been added.

```sql
-- 1. Create the table if it doesn't already exist (this won't overwrite the table if it exists).
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crawl_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
);

-- 2. Add the new columns if they are missing.
ALTER TABLE crawl_results
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS page_url TEXT,
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS raw_markdown TEXT,
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_modified TIMESTAMP,
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
```

### Notes & Explanation

1. **CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS**
   - This ensures that if the table isn’t already present, it’s created with at least the `id` column. If the table exists, Postgres simply skips creation without raising an error.

2. **ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS**
   - This allows you to add each new column (`page_url`, `raw_markdown`, `last_modified`, `created_at`) if the column doesn’t already exist.
   - If the columns do exist, Postgres simply does nothing for that column.

3. **`created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()`**
   - Ensures a timestamp is automatically inserted at row creation.
   - If you need to track updates for `last_modified`, you could later add a trigger or update the column in your application logic whenever a row changes.

---

By incorporating the `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses, you avoid errors when running the script repeatedly. This is often useful for production or CI/CD pipelines where you’re applying SQL migrations that might be run multiple times.

If you want to add more functionality—like automatically updating `last_modified` whenever the row changes—you might consider a trigger such as:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_last_modified()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.last_modified = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER set_last_modified
BEFORE UPDATE ON crawl_results
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_last_modified();
```

That way, whenever you update a row, the `last_modified` column will be set automatically. This can be particularly helpful in scenarios where you need to keep track of changes over time (e.g., for debugging, data audits, or advanced analytics on crawl data).

It looks like you’re hitting a syntax error because of the way the `ALTER TABLE` command is being used. The correct syntax to add a column (including constraints like `UNIQUE`) is:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crawl_results
ADD COLUMN page_url TEXT UNIQUE;
```

**Key points to fix the error:**

1. **You must include the keyword `ADD COLUMN`** (and optionally `IF NOT EXISTS`) after `ALTER TABLE table_name`.
2. **You cannot place the column definition in parentheses** directly after the table name.

So, if you want to add multiple columns at once, each with its own definition, you can do:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crawl_results
  ADD COLUMN page_url TEXT UNIQUE,
  ADD COLUMN raw_markdown TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN last_modified TIMESTAMP,
  ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
```

Or, if you prefer to add each column separately:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crawl_results ADD COLUMN page_url TEXT UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE crawl_results ADD COLUMN raw_markdown TEXT;
ALTER TABLE crawl_results ADD COLUMN last_modified TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE crawl_results ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
```

Make sure you’re typing these commands directly in psql (or your database GUI) as standard SQL statements. If you’re embedding these commands in a programming language (like JavaScript, Python, etc.), ensure they’re wrapped in a string and passed to your database driver correctly.

ADD COLUMN page_url TEXT UNIQUE;
ERROR:  column "page_url" of relation "crawl_results" already exists

When you see the error **“column ‘page\_url’ of relation ‘crawl\_results’ already exists”**, it means the column is already in your table. If your goal is to make that *existing* column `page_url` unique, you need to add a **unique constraint** rather than adding the column again.

Here’s how to do that:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crawl_results
ADD CONSTRAINT crawl_results_page_url_unique
    UNIQUE (page_url);
```

This statement tells PostgreSQL:

1. **ALTER TABLE crawl\_results**: We are modifying the `crawl_results` table.
2. **ADD CONSTRAINT crawl\_results\_page\_url\_unique**: We are adding a new named constraint (you can choose any name for the constraint).
3. **UNIQUE (page\_url)**: This enforces that the `page_url` values are unique across all rows.

### Common Gotchas

- If the table already has **duplicate** values in `page_url`, PostgreSQL will raise an error when you try to add the UNIQUE constraint. You must first ensure all existing data is unique (for example, by removing or updating duplicate rows).
- If you already have a unique constraint on that column with a different name, you might see an error that the constraint exists. In that case, you can rename or drop the old constraint first.
- PostgreSQL does **not** support `ADD COLUMN ... IF NOT EXISTS` with a constraint in a single statement the way it does with a column. Constraints must be added with their own `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT` statement. If you need “if not exists” logic for constraints, you have to do some condition checking in a DO block or just rely on the statement to fail if it already exists.

Once this constraint is successfully in place, `page_url` will be enforced to be unique.

There are a few ways to avoid typing your GitHub username and password every time you push or pull. The most common (and secure) approach is to use SSH keys, though you can also use Git’s credential caching if you prefer a simpler setup.

---

## 1. Using SSH Keys (Recommended)

1. **Generate an SSH key** (if you don’t already have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - Press **Enter** to accept the default file location (usually `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
   - Optionally, add a passphrase for extra security (you’ll need to enter it each time you use the key or you can use an ssh-agent to cache it).

2. **Add the SSH public key to your GitHub account**:
   - Copy the public key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to [GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys) → **New SSH Key**
   - Paste the key, give it a name/label, and click **Add SSH key**.

3. **Clone (or re-remote) using SSH**:
   - Instead of cloning via `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`, clone with `git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git`.
   - If you already have the repo cloned with HTTPS, you can update it:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git
     ```

Once that’s set up, whenever you push or pull, Git will use your SSH key. If you’re using an ssh-agent (which is typically running by default on many Linux distros), it will cache your passphrase so you usually won’t have to type it every time.

---

## 2. Using Git Credential Cache (Plain Text or Memory Cache)

If you want to continue using HTTPS instead of SSH, you can have Git store your username/token locally. This approach is less secure than using SSH, but is simpler if you trust your local machine.

### 2.1. Store Credentials in Memory Temporarily

```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

- This caches your credentials in memory for 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- You can adjust the timeout to any number of seconds.

### 2.2. Store Credentials **Plain Text** (Not Recommended for Sensitive Machines)

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

- The next time you push or pull, Git will prompt for your username and password. After that, it will store them in `~/.git-credentials`.
- **Warning**: This is not encrypted, so anyone with access to your home directory can read them.

---

## 3. Using a GitHub Personal Access Token (HTTPS)

If you have 2FA set up on GitHub or prefer to use tokens:

1. Create a **personal access token** (or [fine-grained PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)) from [GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (classic) or “Fine-grained tokens.”
2. When Git asks for your **Username**, enter your GitHub username (e.g., `your-github-username`).
3. When Git asks for your **Password**, use the token (not your actual password).

Then you can store it using the methods in **2.1** or **2.2** above.

---

### Which Method to Choose?

- **SSH Keys**: Most common, best practice, and you don’t have to re-enter credentials after initial setup (unless you secure the key with a passphrase).
- **Credential Helper (cache)**: Good if you want to stick with HTTPS and don’t mind entering credentials occasionally. Password/Token is saved in memory for a set time.
- **Credential Helper (store)**: Saves your credentials unencrypted on disk. Easy, but less secure.
- **Personal Access Token**: Required if you enable 2FA on GitHub and want to continue using HTTPS. Use it with either the cache or store approach to avoid retyping.

**Recommendation**: If possible, use the SSH approach. It’s more secure, widely used, and once configured, you rarely have to think about credentials again.
