It looks like you‚Äôve successfully installed **FirefoxPWA** via Homebrew. Here‚Äôs what to do next and how to get started using it:

---

## 1. Add the FirefoxPWA Native Messaging Host Manifest (Optional, but Recommended)

This step is only necessary if you want to integrate the **browser extension** (so that PWAs installed through FirefoxPWA show up as distinct apps).

**Terminal commands:**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts"
sudo ln -sf "/opt/homebrew/opt/firefoxpwa/share/firefoxpwa.json" "/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/firefoxpwa.json"
```

What this does:

- `mkdir -p` ensures that the folder `/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts` exists.
- `ln -sf` creates (or updates) a symbolic link so that Firefox can find the **FirefoxPWA** native messaging file `firefoxpwa.json`.

If you do **not** want to use the extension, you can skip this. However, linking the manifest makes it possible for FirefoxPWA to manage apps more seamlessly.

---

## 2. Make Sure Homebrew is in Your PATH

Homebrew‚Äôs ‚ÄúNext steps‚Äù message suggests adding the following lines to your `~/.zprofile` (you‚Äôve likely already done this, but just double-check):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

If you open a new terminal and type `which firefoxpwa`, it should point to `/opt/homebrew/bin/firefoxpwa` (or similar). If it doesn‚Äôt, close and reopen your terminal or source your `~/.zprofile`:

```bash
source ~/.zprofile
```

---

## 3. Using FirefoxPWA

Once installed, **FirefoxPWA** provides commands that let you install, open, list, or remove PWAs (Progressive Web Apps). Common commands include:

1. **Install a site as a PWA**

   ```bash
   firefoxpwa install <URL> [--name "Custom App Name"] [--icon /path/to/icon.png]
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   firefoxpwa install https://twitter.com --name "Twitter" --icon ~/Downloads/twitter-icon.png
   ```

   - This will create a self-contained PWA in your Applications folder (or wherever you specify).
   - You can optionally provide a custom name and icon; otherwise, FirefoxPWA will try to use the site‚Äôs metadata.

2. **Open a previously installed PWA**

   ```bash
   firefoxpwa open <URL or App Name>
   ```

   - For instance, if you installed Twitter as shown above, you could do:

     ```bash
     firefoxpwa open Twitter
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     firefoxpwa open https://twitter.com
     ```

3. **List installed PWAs**

   ```bash
   firefoxpwa list
   ```

   - This shows all PWAs you‚Äôve installed with FirefoxPWA, along with their installation paths.

4. **Uninstall a PWA**

   ```bash
   firefoxpwa uninstall <URL or App Name>
   ```

   - Cleans up the generated app, icon, etc.

---

## 4. Updating and Uninstalling FirefoxPWA

- **Update** FirefoxPWA to the latest version:

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew upgrade firefoxpwa
  ```

- **Uninstall** FirefoxPWA:

  ```bash
  brew uninstall firefoxpwa
  ```

  If you no longer want the linked manifest for the browser extension, you can remove it:

  ```bash
  sudo rm "/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/firefoxpwa.json"
  ```

---

## 5. Further Documentation

- **FirefoxPWA GitHub repository**:\
  <https://github.com/MrAlex94/FireFoxPWA>\
  Contains more detailed usage instructions, troubleshooting tips, and development notes.

- **Homebrew documentation**:\
  <https://docs.brew.sh>\
  Helpful if you‚Äôre new to Homebrew and want to learn more about installing or managing packages on macOS.

### That‚Äôs it!

With FirefoxPWA installed, you can now create and manage ‚Äútrue‚Äù web app experiences in Firefox. Enjoy your new PWAs!
