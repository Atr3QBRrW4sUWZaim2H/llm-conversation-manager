# App Store Subscription Description

#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:27:59.865Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:27:59 AM">06:27</time>

i'm a product manager at indeed. the indeed ios app is free to use for job seekers. job seekers will always be able to use the core features like searching and applying for jobs. my team has introduced a monthly subscription that job sekers can pay for via in app purchases. this subsctiption unlocks features that are additive to indeed; for example the ability to find jobs that you're a top applicant for or the ability to highlight a small number of job applications each month to employers. we need to update the apple app store description to tell job seekers about this subsctiption optione, but we also want to make sure job seekers understand that they don't need to pay to access the features that they are already using. how can we help job seekers understang this? the question that apple asks is "22.  Please describe the pricing for the Product."

#### ChatGPT:

When you respond to Apple’s question about pricing for the subscription, you want to be **clear, concise, and transparent** about the payment details **and** the fact that the app’s core functionality remains free. Apple generally requires:

1. A straightforward explanation of **what** is being sold (e.g., “monthly subscription”).
2. A clear breakdown of **how much it costs** (e.g., “$X.XX per month”).
3. Disclosure that the app’s **existing free features remain free**, and that the subscription simply **unlocks additional features**.

Below is a sample response you might provide in the submission form or the App Store description:

---

**Sample Explanation (Answer to “22. Please describe the pricing for the Product.”)**

> The Indeed iOS app remains completely **free to download** and **free to use** for all core job search and application features.
>
> We also offer an **optional monthly subscription** (auto-renewing) at **$X.XX per month** that unlocks **additional premium features** such as:\
> • **Finding jobs where you’re a top applicant**\
> • **Highlighting a limited number of applications** to employers each month
>
> Existing free features (like searching and applying to jobs) are **not restricted** and will **always remain available at no cost**. Payment for the premium subscription will be charged to your iTunes account, and your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your account settings at any time.

---

### Why this helps job seekers understand:

1. **Plain Language**: Avoid jargon. Clearly say “the app’s main features are free” and “this subscription is optional.”
2. **Benefits Summary**: List the **exclusive features** the subscription provides, reinforcing why it might be valuable.
3. **No Penalty**: Emphasize that job seekers **lose no current functionality** by not subscribing, maintaining trust.
4. **Clear Pricing & Renewal Info**: Apple wants straightforward details on **cost** and **auto-renewal** so users know exactly what to expect.

From a **product management** perspective, this clear distinction between free and paid tiers will reduce confusion and frustration, while also highlighting the **value add** of the subscription. This approach aligns well with App Store guidelines for in-app purchases and ensures that job seekers feel **informed** and **empowered** about whether or not to subscribe.


#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:30:30.616Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:30:30 AM">06:30</time>

this is a great start! there are many features; do you think we need to list all of them out?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:30:48.095Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:30:48 AM">06:30</time>

It’s generally best to **keep it concise** in the App Store listing—and in the specific response to Apple—by focusing on the **most compelling, value-adding features** rather than listing everything exhaustively. Apple’s review team typically wants to see clear, high-level information on:

1. **Pricing:** What is the cost?
2. **Payment terms:** Auto-renewing subscription, cancellation policy, etc.
3. **Value proposition:** What does the subscription unlock that is *most relevant* or *most beneficial* to job seekers?

### Why Not List *All* Features?

- **Overwhelming for Readers:** Job seekers (and Apple’s review team) can lose interest or get confused if confronted with a “laundry list” of every possible feature.
- **Simplicity Sells:** Conveying the *most compelling* or *unique* benefits at a glance helps users quickly understand the value and decide if it’s worth the price.
- **Space Constraints:** There’s limited text real estate in the App Store listing. Lengthy descriptions can clutter your message and lead to lower readability.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Highlight Top Features:** Select a few bullet points that represent the *biggest draws* (e.g., top applicant insights, ability to highlight applications, or anything that clearly gives the user an advantage in their job search).
2. **Group or Summarize Other Perks:** If there are multiple smaller perks (like saved settings, extra filters, or anything else that’s “nice-to-have”), consider grouping them into a single bullet or short sentence (e.g., “Plus, enjoy additional advanced features that streamline your job search.”).
3. **Emphasize Free Core Features:** Make it clear that the subscription doesn’t *remove* or *limit* any free core functionality such as job search and applying.

By following this approach, you **inform** job seekers of the most enticing benefits without overwhelming them, and you satisfy Apple’s requirement to describe what’s being sold without creating an overly detailed (and potentially confusing) list. This balance keeps your App Store description *reader-friendly* and *transparent*.

Below are three sample descriptions (varying in style and length) that you might use or adapt for your App Store listing. Each one is designed to be clear about the subscription offering, the pricing structure, and the fact that free core features remain accessible. Feel free to mix and match elements that resonate with your team and align with your branding guidelines.

---

## **Option 1: Short & Concise**

**Description of Pricing for Monthly Subscription**

> The Indeed iOS app is free to download and use for all core job search and application features. We also offer an *optional* monthly subscription at **$X.XX/month** that unlocks additional benefits, including:\
> • Insight into which jobs you’re a top applicant for\
> • The ability to highlight a limited number of applications each month
>
> Free features remain fully accessible, and your subscription renews automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

**Why choose this style?**

- Very brief and to-the-point
- Ideal if you have limited text space or want to avoid overwhelming users
- Emphasizes the optional nature and key benefits quickly

---

## **Option 2: Balanced Detail with Bullet Points**

**Description of Pricing for Monthly Subscription**

> **Free Core Features, Plus Optional Premium Benefits**
>
> - **Free to Use:** All core features—such as searching, saving, and applying for jobs—are *completely free* and always will be.
> - **Premium Subscription ($X.XX/month):** Unlock extra tools to give your job search a boost. You’ll get:
>   - **Top Applicant Insights:** See which roles you’re a standout candidate for.
>   - **Application Highlighting:** Highlight a limited number of applications each month to catch employers’ attention.
>   - **Additional Perks:** Access more advanced features that make your job hunt faster and more personalized.
>
> Payment is charged to your iTunes account. Your subscription renews automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your account settings any time.

**Why choose this style?**

- Strikes a balance between brevity and detail
- Uses bullet points to quickly highlight key premium features
- Reinforces that core functionality remains free

---

## **Option 3: More Marketing Flair & Reassurance**

**Description of Pricing for Monthly Subscription**

> **Get More Out of Your Job Search—Only if You Want To**
>
> The Indeed app is **free to download** and gives you access to all the essential tools you need to search and apply for jobs—no strings attached. For those who want to take their job hunt to the next level, we offer an **optional monthly subscription** at **$X.XX**:
>
> 1. **Top Applicant Recommendations** – Quickly spot the roles where you’re likely to stand out.
> 2. **Application Spotlight** – Highlight your profile on a limited number of job applications each month, helping employers notice you first.
> 3. **Future-Forward Features** – Unlock additional perks (like enhanced resume insights or advanced search filters) to get the most from Indeed.
>
> Your subscription renews automatically. You can cancel any time in your account settings, and the standard free features you already rely on **will never go away**.

**Why choose this style?**

- Uses a friendly, reassuring tone
- Emphasizes “no obligation” and “optional”
- Positions the subscription as an enhancement, not a requirement

---

### **Tips for Finalizing Your Copy**

1. **Match Tone to Brand:** Use language and phrasing that align with Indeed’s brand voice.
2. **Keep It Clear:** Ensure pricing and auto-renewal details are unambiguous.
3. **Highlight Value:** Focus on the *key* or *most compelling* differentiators of the subscription.
4. **Reassure Users:** Always remind them that the app’s core job search and application features remain free.

You can pick the version that best suits your **App Store constraints**, **brand persona**, or **marketing goals**, or you can combine elements from all three for your final description.


#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:31:52.744Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:31:52 AM">06:31</time>

didn't you just recommend to not list the features? I'm confused. did i misunderstand

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:32:06.629Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:32:06 AM">06:32</time>

It’s understandable that it might feel contradictory at first. However, the **key distinction** is between:

1. **Listing *all* features in extreme detail:** This can overwhelm your audience, clutter your text, and isn’t usually necessary for App Store approval.
2. **Highlighting a few select features:** This is a concise way to convey the *value* of your subscription without bogging down the description with every single perk.

In other words, rather than providing an exhaustive list of every subscription feature (a “laundry list”), you can still mention **two or three high-impact or most relevant features** to illustrate the benefits of the paid subscription. That way, potential subscribers quickly understand **why** they might want to pay, while also seeing that **core features remain free**.

### Why mention *some* features at all?

- **Value Proposition**: Job seekers want a *brief* glimpse of what extra functionality they’d gain.
- **Clarity for Apple**: Apple’s review team wants to ensure the subscription is clearly defined in terms of **what** you’re selling and **why** it costs money.
- **User Trust**: Providing a short highlight (e.g., “Top Applicant,” “Application Spotlight”) helps job seekers understand the subscription’s purpose without wading through unnecessary detail.

### In Practice

- **Good:** “Our subscription includes Top Applicant insights and the ability to highlight a limited number of applications each month.”
- **Too Much:** “Our subscription includes: advanced job insights, advanced resume analytics, early-access job alerts, premium job matching, employer spotlighting… \[list continues].”

By focusing on just the **top few** bullet points (and grouping or summarizing the rest as “additional premium features”), you avoid confusion, maintain user interest, and answer Apple’s questions effectively. So, you’re still *mentioning* key features (to show value), but you’re *not* listing them all exhaustively.


#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:35:33.442Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:35:33 AM">06:35</time>

great. how should we explain this internally 

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T21:36:01.804Z" title="1/22/2025, 6:36:01 AM">06:36</time>

Below is a suggested way to explain the rationale for how we describe the subscription (and its features) **internally**—whether to stakeholders, leadership, or cross-functional teams like marketing, product, legal, and design. The goal is to clarify *why* we avoid listing *all* features in the App Store description, yet still highlight a few to illustrate value.

---

## 1. **Context: Apple’s Requirements & User Perception**

- **App Store Guidelines**: Apple expects a *clear, concise* explanation of what users get for the subscription and how much it costs. Listing every single feature in minute detail can overwhelm, confuse, or appear as “spammy.”
- **User Attention Span**: Most job seekers skim text on the App Store. Long paragraphs or exhaustive lists reduce readability and can deter downloads.

**Key Point**: We want to meet Apple’s requirements by explaining the subscription’s price and benefits *without* burdening the user with too much detail.

---

## 2. **Balancing Detail vs. Clarity**

- **Highlight High-Impact Features**: We aim to showcase *select* premium capabilities (e.g., “Top Applicant,” “Highlighted Applications”) that clearly explain **why** someone might pay, rather than listing every small perk.
- **Avoid “Laundry Lists”**: While we *could* detail every feature, it would dilute the message. It’s more effective to emphasize the *main draws*—the top 2-3 benefits that give a clear sense of *value*.

**Key Point**: Mention enough to demonstrate the subscription is valuable, but remain succinct to avoid confusion.

---

## 3. **Preserving Free Core Features**

- **Reassurance**: Job seekers must understand that the core Indeed experience—job search and applications—remains completely free.
- **Optional Upgrade**: By positioning the subscription as optional and additive, we reinforce trust and avoid alienating users who rely on the free features.

**Key Point**: Our messaging should consistently reiterate that the free experience is unchanged, preventing fears that they *must* pay.

---

## 4. **Messaging Strategy**

1. **Short Description**: Begin with a simple sentence acknowledging core features are free and always will be.
2. **Subscription Summary**: Explain that the subscription is auto-renewing at `\$X.XX/month`, plus a quick mention of premium perks.
3. **Key Features (2-3 Bullets)**: Highlight the *main selling points*:
   - “Top Applicant” insights
   - “Highlight Applications”
   - Possibly 1 additional perk or a grouped mention of “other advanced features”
4. **Clear Call to Action**: Inform users they can subscribe if they want the extra benefits, but no *existing* features are locked behind a paywall.

**Key Point**: Keep it under 100 words if possible (or just a few bullet points), which is typically enough for the App Store description.

---

## 5. **Internal Benefits of This Approach**

- **Adheres to Apple’s Guidelines**: Minimizing the likelihood of rejections or requests for more clarifications from Apple during app review.
- **Strong Brand Trust**: Users appreciate transparency and clarity, reducing negative feedback or confusion about “hidden fees.”
- **Efficient Onboarding**: Job seekers can quickly decide if the subscription is right for them or if they’re happy with the free features—leading to better user satisfaction.

**Key Point**: A concise, honest subscription explanation can help drive adoption *and* maintain high user satisfaction.

---

## 6. **Where to Put More Detail (If Needed)**

- **FAQ or Help Center**: We can point users to a support page or help article if they want the *full* breakdown of each subscription feature.
- **In-App Explanations**: Within the app, we could show more tooltips or expanded details about premium features, but only when users show interest (e.g., tapping “Learn More”).

**Key Point**: The App Store listing is “top of funnel.” More comprehensive information can live elsewhere for those who want it.

---

### **TL;DR for Internal Stakeholders**

We deliberately keep our subscription description brief to satisfy both Apple’s guidelines and user expectations. By featuring just the *most compelling benefits* and clearly stating pricing, we showcase the subscription’s value without overshadowing Indeed’s free core functionalities. This careful balance bolsters user trust, meets compliance standards, and optimizes the App Store experience.

Here’s a **concise, 1–2 sentence** suggestion for the “\[Upgrade to Indeed Premium…]” section that highlights the subscription’s value without overwhelming the user:

> **Upgrade to Indeed Premium with an optional monthly subscription that unlocks extra features—like Top Applicant insights and the ability to highlight applications—to give your job hunt an extra edge. Core features, including searching and applying for jobs, remain free for everyone.**

This phrasing:

- **Clearly states it’s an optional subscription** (not mandatory).
- **Highlights a couple of main benefits** (Top Applicant, highlighting applications) without listing *everything*.
- **Reassures users** that searching and applying to jobs **stay free**.

Feel free to adjust the exact wording or benefit examples to best reflect the most compelling Premium features.

does one of the screenshots have to show the paid feature? we are just beta testing and don't want to publicize it too much

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T22:38:18.482Z" title="1/22/2025, 7:38:18 AM">07:38</time>

Generally, **Apple does *not* require** that your screenshots specifically showcase a paid feature. What Apple *does* require is:

1. **Clear communication of in-app purchases/subscriptions** in your App Store listing (description, IAP metadata, etc.).
2. **Accurate depiction** of your app’s core functionality in screenshots.

So if you’d prefer *not* to highlight the subscription visually (especially if it’s still in beta), you can use screenshots that focus on the **core features** while simply **mentioning** the subscription in your textual description. This should be sufficient for App Review as long as:

- Your listing **mentions the subscription** in a way that’s transparent (you’ve done this in your description).
- You don’t create a **misleading** impression about what’s free vs. paid.

If Apple asks for clarification or wants to see how the subscription appears, you can provide **additional notes in App Store Connect** or attach an extra screenshot in the submission notes. But in most cases, having an in-app purchase or subscription **does not mandate** that one of the core screenshots must explicitly feature the paid feature—especially if you’ve clearly described it in your listing.


#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-21T22:41:42.212Z" title="1/22/2025, 7:41:42 AM">07:41</time>

<time datetime="2025-01-21T22:42:15.686Z" title="1/22/2025, 7:42:15 AM">07:42</time>

When you submit an app that *introduces* in-app subscriptions for the first time, Apple’s review process typically includes a few additional checks. Here’s how to prepare:

---

## **1. Include Required Subscription Information in the App & Metadata**

- **In-App Purchase/Subscription Metadata**:
  - Make sure your subscription product in App Store Connect has a clear name, description, and pricing.
  - Include the standard subscription disclaimers (e.g., auto-renewal, cancellation, etc.).

- **App Description**:
  - Clearly state that it’s an optional subscription, how much it costs, and what benefits it unlocks.
  - Emphasize that core features remain free (if relevant).
  - Confirm you have the auto-renewal/cancellation details. For example:
    - “Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.
    - Subscription auto-renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
    - Manage or cancel your subscription in Account Settings at any time.”

---

## **2. Provide Demo or Testing Instructions for the Review Team**

- If your app **requires login** to access the subscription flow, Apple will need a **test account** to confirm the purchase and see premium features in action.
- In App Store Connect’s “**App Review Information**” section, you can add **Notes** for the reviewer, explaining how to log in or how to reach the subscription screen.
- If the subscription is in a **beta test or only shown to certain users**, detail any steps the reviewer must take to access or activate that flow (e.g., “Tap on ‘Profile’ → ‘Subscription’ in the Settings page…”).

---

## **3. Screenshots & App Previews**

- **Are screenshots of the paid feature required?**
  - Apple *does not explicitly require* that you show premium features in your primary screenshots if you prefer to focus on the core (free) functionality. It’s acceptable to mention the subscription in text only.
  - However, if you do show them, ensure that the screenshots accurately depict the in-app purchase or subscription screen so Apple can see how users would subscribe.
- **If you don’t want to showcase the paid feature** (especially if it’s in beta), it’s fine to keep your screenshots focused on the main user journey—just make sure the *description* meets the guidelines for transparency.

---

## **4. Common Additional Review Checks**

When Apple sees a new subscription for the first time, they’ll often verify:

1. **Pricing & Terms**: Are subscription terms clear? Does your description mention price, renewal frequency, and cancellation?
2. **Functionality**: Does the subscription purchase process work properly, and does it deliver the promised premium features?
3. **Compliance with Guidelines**:
   - Guideline 3.1.2 (In-App Purchase): Ensures you’re using Apple’s in-app purchase system correctly.
   - Guideline 2.1 (Performance) and 4.0 (Design): Confirms the app is stable and meets user interface standards.
   - Any disclaimers or privacy/terms of service references as required.

---

## **5. Final Tips**

1. **Double-Check Your “Review Notes”**
   - In App Store Connect, include brief but clear instructions for Apple’s reviewers on how to test the subscription.
   - If relevant, provide a test login (with steps to replicate the purchase flow).

2. **Highlight “Optional”**
   - Apple is keen on user experience. Reinforcing that it’s an *optional* subscription helps avoid confusion or the impression that the app is paywalled.

3. **Ensure All Legal Links Are Present**
   - If you have Terms of Service or Privacy Policy updates specific to the subscription, verify those links are easily accessible (in the app and in the store listing).

---

### **In Summary**

- Yes, there can be a slightly more detailed review when introducing subscriptions.
- Provide clear subscription info (pricing, auto-renewal details) in your app description and metadata.
- Make sure you give the review team everything they need (test accounts or instructions) to successfully evaluate the subscription flow.

By proactively addressing these areas, you’ll minimize back-and-forth with Apple and increase the likelihood of a smooth review process.

Yes, you can absolutely limit the subscription’s visibility and availability to Canada by making a few **App Store Connect** configuration updates and adjusting your **App Store listing** just for that region. Here’s how:

---

## 1. **Localize and Update the App Store Description Specifically for Canada**

- In **App Store Connect → App Information → Localizable Information**, you can provide separate descriptions for each region.
- For example, choose **“English (Canada)”** and insert the subscription text there, while *omitting* or *toning it down* for other locales (like “English (U.S.)”).
- This ensures that **only users viewing the App Store in Canada** see the detailed subscription explanation.

---

## 2. **Limit Subscription Availability by Territory**

- Under **App Store Connect → In-App Purchases → Pricing and Availability**, you can specify which countries the subscription is sold in.
- If you select only Canada, **users outside Canada won’t be able to purchase** (or even see) that subscription in the in-app purchase listings.
- This is the most foolproof way to ensure the subscription is only accessible to Canadian users.

---

## 3. **In-App Gating or Feature Flag (Optional but Recommended)**

- In your app’s code, you could use a **feature flag** or **region check** to show the subscription prompt **only** if the user’s account or IP is recognized as Canadian.
- That way, if someone outside Canada somehow sees references to the subscription (or downloads the Canadian build, for instance), they still won’t be able to activate it unless they meet your eligibility rules.

---

## 4. **Review & Testing**

- **Review the localized metadata**: Make sure your “English (Canada)” description clearly states the subscription is optional, includes pricing, and adheres to Apple’s auto-renewal disclosure requirements.
- **Test on a Canadian Apple ID**: Confirm that the subscription listing and purchase flow function as expected in Canada and remain hidden in other countries.

---

## 5. **Summary of Key Precautions**

1. **Description Localization**: Only mention or emphasize the subscription in “English (Canada).”
2. **Territory Restriction**: In App Store Connect, limit the in-app purchase to Canada.
3. **(Optional) In-App Feature Flag**: Show subscription prompts only to Canadian users, if extra caution is needed.

Following these steps ensures only users in Canada discover and can purchase the new subscription, while everyone else continues to see your existing, non-subscription experience.

Apple’s standard **App Review timeline** can vary, but here are some general expectations and considerations when introducing an entirely new subscription:

1. **Typical Review Window**
   - For most app updates, Apple’s review can range anywhere from **24 hours to a few days**. However, there’s no strict guaranteed timeline.
   - If your submission is straightforward and you provide all necessary details (test account credentials, subscription info, etc.), you might get approval within **1–3 business days**.

2. **Potential for Additional Review Steps**
   - When you **add a new subscription for the first time**, Apple may take extra time to ensure your **payment flow** and **descriptions** comply with guidelines (e.g., clarifying that it’s an auto-renewable subscription, that pricing is transparent, and that free features remain accessible).
   - If Apple’s reviewers have questions or find anything unclear, they’ll reach out via **App Store Connect** for more information, which can extend the review period.

3. **Tips to Avoid Delays**
   - **Provide Test Credentials**: If your app requires login, give the reviewer a test account in the “Review Notes” section so they can easily access and test the subscription features.
   - **Include Clear Documentation**: Be explicit about subscription pricing, renewal details, and how to cancel within the description.
   - **Check All Localizations**: If you’re only enabling the subscription in Canada, ensure the “English (Canada)” description is accurate and that the subscription is limited to that territory.

4. **Worst-Case Scenarios**
   - If Apple flags something for **Design or Guideline** reasons, they may **reject** or **ask for clarification**. Responding promptly usually resolves these requests without major delays.
   - Major policy issues (e.g., incomplete subscription info or missing disclaimers) might trigger repeated rounds of review, so be thorough the first time.

### **Bottom Line on Timelines**

- Plan for **a few days** of review time. In many cases it can be quicker, but if Apple requests additional info, expect a longer back-and-forth.
- Providing clear subscription details and a test flow significantly **reduces the risk of delays**.

Overall, you should anticipate slightly more scrutiny than a normal update because the subscription is new, but if everything is well-documented, you’ll typically see approval within the standard **1–3 day** window.
