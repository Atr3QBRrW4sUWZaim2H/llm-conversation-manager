How to migrate chats from a ChatGPT account to different ChatGPT account.
Updated over a month ago

Note: This workaround involves exporting the JSON file with all your chats from one account and uploading it into a new conversation in your primary account. Depending on the file size, you may need to split the JSON into smaller files before uploading. Keep in mind that this process isn’t a direct, one-to-one recreation of your previous chat history. For example, if you originally had 10 separate chats, you may end up with a single conversation containing all that data in your new account.

Follow these steps in this article to ensure you just have 1 Plus or Pro subscription and transfer your data export file from the original account to the new account. ChatGPT does not have a merge accounts feature so this is a workaround to migrating data manually from one ChatGPT Plus or Pro account to another.

⚠️ You can't export from a ChatGPT Team account. For details on how one merges their Team/Personal workspaces see Can I migrate or merge my ChatGPT Free or Plus workspace over to my ChatGPT Team workspace?
Choose your primary account

Decide which account you want to keep active and maintain your Plus or Pro subscription on.

 
Cancel Plus subscription (if necessary)

If your non-primary account has a Plus or Pro subscription, cancel it to avoid double charges. This ensures you maintain the subscription only on your chosen primary account.

 
Export data from the legacy account

In your account that you plan to stop using, export your data. This generates a .zip file containing a conversations.json among other files.

Import data to your primary account

Start a new conversation in your primary account and upload the conversations.json file. This won't recreate the conversations in your chat history, but it allows you to keep a record of them accessible within a conversation in your primary account for historical context.

To migrate your conversations from one ChatGPT account to another, here's a concise step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Choose Your Primary Account**

Decide which account will be your main one for continued use.

### 2. **Cancel Plus/Pro Subscription (If Necessary)**

- If the account you're discontinuing has a Plus or Pro subscription, cancel it to avoid duplicate charges.
- Retain the subscription only on your primary account.

### 3. **Export Data from Your Legacy Account**

- Log in to the account you plan to stop using.
- Export your data by going to **Settings > Data Controls > Export Data**.
- You'll receive an email with a link to download a `.zip` file. This file contains your conversations in a `conversations.json` file.

### 4. **Import Data to Your Primary Account**

- Log in to your primary account.
- Start a new conversation and upload the `conversations.json` file.
- This won't integrate chats into your conversation history directly, but you'll have access to them in this single conversation for reference.

### Notes

- If the `conversations.json` file is large, consider splitting it into smaller files before uploading.
- You can't export data from a ChatGPT Team account to a personal account.

The conversations.json file is 16mb. Can I upload that?

Currently, uploading a 16 MB file might exceed the limits for some platforms or cause issues with processing in a chat context. Here's how to handle it effectively:

### Steps to Manage a Large `conversations.json` File:

1. **Check Upload Limits:**
   - If the platform you're using (e.g., ChatGPT or any related app) doesn't explicitly mention file size limits, try uploading the file directly.
   - If it fails, proceed to the next steps.

2. **Split the JSON File:**
   - Use a text editor or a JSON splitter tool to divide the `conversations.json` file into smaller chunks. Aim for files under 5 MB for smooth handling.
   - Ensure each part is a valid JSON file by keeping the necessary opening and closing brackets intact for each chunk.

3. **Compress the Content:**
   - If splitting isn't feasible, compress the file into a `.zip` format. Most systems can handle compressed files more efficiently.

4. **Alternative Upload Methods:**
   - If the platform allows partial uploads or sequential file additions, split the content into manageable sections and upload them one by one.
