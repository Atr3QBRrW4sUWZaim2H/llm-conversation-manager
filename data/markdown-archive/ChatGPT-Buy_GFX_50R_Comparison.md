    Nicely-designed camera with great image-quality.
    The camera is well designed and the sensor is in a different league (which is precisely why anyone would buy a camera such as this). Be aware that the camera is far slower than a regular full-frame camera, so it won‚Äôt be to everyone‚Äôs taste. I got mine for portrait work, and it is perfect for that application.

    Incredible camera... coming from XT series is very easy to use. Large camera but well worth it... that‚Äôs what tripods are for!

    My favorite camera
    The Fuji GFX 50R is my favorite & a perfect camera for my photography-architecture & landscape. The IQ is phenomenal & the details are insane. As a Fuji user, this medium format camera is a natural transition to the next level. The ergonomics & menu are the same as the XP3. My biggest joy is the 65:24 aspect ratio for a cinematic perspective. A dream camera.

    Simple Medium Format
    Excellent camera. Thought about the GFX 100S, but 50MP is more than I really need. Stunning image quality in a well built, simple, no frills body.

    Nicely-designed camera with great image-quality.
    The camera is well designed and the sensor is in a different league (which is precisely why anyone would buy a camera such as this). Be aware that the camera is far slower than a regular full-frame camera, so it won‚Äôt be to everyone‚Äôs taste. I got mine for portrait work, and it is perfect for that application.

    Fuji all the way!
    Incredible camera... coming from XT series is very easy to use. Large camera but well worth it... that‚Äôs what tripods are for!

    My favorite camera
    The Fuji GFX 50R is my favorite & a perfect camera for my photography-architecture & landscape. The IQ is phenomenal & the details are insane. As a Fuji user, this medium format camera is a natural transition to the next level. The ergonomics & menu are the same as the XP3. My biggest joy is the 65:24 aspect ratio for a cinematic perspective. A dream camera.

    Simple Medium Format
    Excellent camera. Thought about the GFX 100S, but 50MP is more than I really need. Stunning image quality in a well built, simple, no frills body.

Here‚Äôs how to decide between the two GFX‚ÄØ50R listings at the same $2,450 price point. In short, it boils down to (1) **seller track record**, (2) **exact condition/accessories**, (3) **shipping cost and time**, and (4) **your own location**:

1. **Seller Reputation & Feedback**
   - One seller (\**evandphoto*\*) has more total feedback and more items sold, all 100% positive. That‚Äôs a modest but reliable track record.
   - The other seller (\**kybe\_19*\*) also shows 100% positive but with fewer total feedback (and fewer items sold). That doesn‚Äôt automatically mean anything bad, but it‚Äôs less history to go on.

2. **Condition Details & Extras**
   - If one listing includes more photos, a clearer mention of shutter count, or extras (battery, charger, strap, original box, etc.), that can make the difference.
   - ‚ÄúUsed, well cared for, in great condition‚Äù is always a good sign. Still, look closely at photos or ask for more details (cosmetic marks, missing covers, etc.).

3. **Shipping Cost & Speed**
   - One is offering *free* shipping; the other charges around $16.
   - Check which seller is geographically closer. If you happen to live near one, it could arrive faster or be easier (sometimes local pickup or shorter shipping windows).

4. **Return Policy & Buyer Protection**
   - Both appear to have ‚Äúno returns,‚Äù so you‚Äôll be relying on eBay‚Äôs Money Back Guarantee. In that case, you usually want the seller with a longer sales history and proven positive feedback.

5. **Ask for Final Clarifications**
   - Before pulling the trigger, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask each seller for a quick video or extra photos verifying everything works (screens, EVF, buttons, sensor, etc.).
   - If both respond promptly and sound knowledgeable/honest, that‚Äôs a plus.

---

### Bottom Line

If both cameras truly appear identical (same condition, no difference in included accessories) and both sellers are equally responsive, **go with the listing from the more established seller who has more positive feedback**‚Äîespecially if they also provide *free* shipping. A proven track record plus no added shipping cost is usually the safer bet. On the other hand, if you find that the newer seller‚Äôs camera has fewer actuations, or includes an extra battery or something that matters to you, that could tilt the decision. Ultimately, the safer route is the seller with stronger feedback, clear condition details, and lower shipping risk.

Based on the details you shared, **go with the camera from ‚Äúevandphoto.‚Äù** That seller has a more established track record (more total feedback, all positive), offers free shipping, and overall appears slightly more reliable. Even though the final price is the same from both sellers, the added peace of mind from a well-reviewed seller plus no shipping cost usually makes it the safer choice.
