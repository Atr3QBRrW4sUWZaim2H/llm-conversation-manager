Prerequisites

Before setting up the Conversations Importer, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
	1.	Operating System: Unix-based systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) are recommended.
	2.	Python: Python 3.6 or higher installed.
	3.	PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL 10 or higher installed and running.
	4.	Git: Installed for cloning the repository.
	5.	Virtual Environment: Recommended for managing Python dependencies.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Conversations-Importer.git
cd Conversations-Importer

Replace yourusername with the actual GitHub username if applicable.

2. Create Directory Structure

Ensure that the necessary directories exist. The following command sets up the required directories if they don’t already exist:

mkdir -p files/to-process files/processed files/failed scripts/logs

3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory (Conversations-Importer/) to store your PostgreSQL credentials securely.

touch .env

Open the .env file in a text editor and add the following variables:

DB_NAME=mydb
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_HOST=192.168.1.200
DB_PORT=5432

Important:
	•	Replace mydb, myuser, mypassword, and 192.168.1.200 with your actual PostgreSQL database name, username, password, and host IP address.
	•	Ensure that the .env file is not committed to version control to protect sensitive information.

4. Set Up the PostgreSQL Database

Create or update the conversations table to handle both the original and new columns used by the scripts. Connect to your PostgreSQL instance:

psql -h 192.168.1.200 -U myuser -d mydb

Replace host, user, and database name as per your configuration.

Create/Update the Table:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                   
    title TEXT NOT NULL,                     
    source UUID NOT NULL,                    
    create_time TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE, 
    datemodified TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,                     
    UNIQUE (title, source)                   
);

-- Add new columns if they don't already exist
ALTER TABLE conversations
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cost numeric,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS model_id text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS model_name text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS num_messages int,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS chat_title text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS preview text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS synced_at timestamp;

Explanation of Columns:
	•	id: Unique identifier for each record.
	•	title: Title of the conversation.
	•	source: Typically a UUID representing the source (from JSON).
	•	create_time: Timestamp when the conversation was created.
	•	datemodified: Timestamp of the last modification to the conversation.
	•	data: Entire conversation data stored as a JSONB object for flexibility.
	•	cost, model_id, model_name, num_messages, chat_title, preview, synced_at:
Additional fields for capturing TypingMind or other relevant metadata.
	•	UNIQUE (title, source): Ensures that each combination of title and source is unique to prevent duplicates.

5. Install Python Dependencies

It’s recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Create a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv scripts/venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:

source scripts/venv/bin/activate

Upgrade pip:

pip install --upgrade pip

Install Required Packages:

pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv

Note: The psycopg2-binary package is used to interact with PostgreSQL, and python-dotenv loads environment variables from the .env file.

Usage

Running the Import Script
	1.	Activate the Virtual Environment:
If not already activated, navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment:

cd Conversations-Importer/scripts
source venv/bin/activate


	2.	Place JSON Files for Processing:
Add your JSON files containing conversation data to the files/to-process directory.

cp /path/to/your/chatgpt-export.json ../files/to-process/


	3.	Execute the Script:
Run the upload.py script to import the JSON files into PostgreSQL.

python3 upload.py

Sample Output:

2025-01-08 21:18:19,116 [INFO] Successfully connected to PostgreSQL.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,116 [INFO] Found 1 JSON file(s) to process.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,116 [INFO] Processing file: chatgpt-export.json
2025-01-08 21:18:19,213 [INFO] Upserted record ID 77 (source=677dedc6-29f8-8002-a841-0aecb03a80b0) at index 1.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,255 [INFO] Moved file chatgpt-export.json to processed directory.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,255 [INFO] Database connection closed.



Understanding File Movements
	•	Processed Files:
Successfully processed JSON files are moved from files/to-process to files/processed.
	•	Failed Files:
JSON files that encounter errors during processing are moved to files/failed for further inspection.

Script Details

upload.py

The upload.py (or import_json.py) script is the core component responsible for importing JSON files into the PostgreSQL conversations table. It performs the following tasks:
	1.	Database Connection:
	•	Connects to PostgreSQL using credentials from the .env file.
	•	Utilizes psycopg2 for database interactions.
	2.	File Processing:
	•	Scans the files/to-process directory for JSON files.
	•	Reads and sanitizes JSON data to remove invalid Unicode characters.
	•	Parses the sanitized JSON string into Python objects.
	3.	Data Validation & TypingMind Logic:
	•	Checks if each JSON file follows the old format (list of conversation dicts) or the TypingMind format ({"data": {"chats": [...]}}).
	•	Also detects if there’s an extra top-level key (e.g., "NewKey") around the {"data":{"chats":[...]}} structure and unwraps it automatically.
	•	Ensures each conversation has all required fields and converts timestamps.
	4.	Columns & Metadata:
	•	In addition to core columns (title, source, create_time, datemodified, data), captures:
	•	cost (numeric)
	•	model_id (text)
	•	model_name (text)
	•	num_messages (int)
	•	chat_title (text)
	•	preview (text)
	•	synced_at (timestamp)
	5.	Database Insertion/Update:
	•	Inserts new records or updates existing ones based on the ON CONFLICT (title, source) clause.
	•	The script logs a message like “No update (datemodified not newer)” if an existing record has an equal or more recent datemodified.
	•	Utilizes RETURNING id to fetch the ID of the inserted/updated record.
	6.	NameError Fix & Logging:
	•	Defines filename within the process_json_file function to avoid NameError.
	•	Maintains comprehensive logs in both the console and scripts/logs/import_json.log.
	•	Implements log rotation to prevent log files from becoming excessively large.

Key Functions:
	•	connect_db(): Establishes a connection to PostgreSQL.
	•	sanitize_json_string(): Cleans the raw JSON string.
	•	sanitize_json(): Recursively sanitizes JSON objects.
	•	convert_timestamp(): Converts various timestamp formats to datetime objects.
	•	process_typingmind_chat(): Handles chats from TypingMind data format.
	•	process_old_format_item(): Handles legacy conversation data items.
	•	process_json_file(): Orchestrates the processing of individual JSON files (detects format, unwraps top-level key if needed).

delete_duplicates.py

Note: This script was mentioned in the project structure but not detailed in the conversation. Assuming it is used to clean duplicate records based on specific criteria.

The delete_duplicates.py script is designed to identify and remove duplicate records from the conversations table. It ensures data integrity by enforcing uniqueness based on the combination of title and source.

Key Features:
	•	Duplicate Identification:
	•	Scans the conversations table for records sharing the same title and source.
	•	Identifies duplicates based on predefined criteria.
	•	Deletion Mechanism:
	•	Removes duplicate entries while retaining the most recent record based on datemodified.
	•	Utilizes SQL queries with window functions or subqueries to efficiently identify duplicates.
	•	Logging:
	•	Logs the number of duplicates found and deleted.
	•	Records details of deleted records for auditing purposes.

Usage:

python3 delete_duplicates.py

Ensure that this script is correctly implemented to avoid unintended data loss.

Logging

Comprehensive logging is implemented to facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.
	•	Log Files:
	•	Location: scripts/logs/import_json.log
	•	Format: Timestamped entries indicating the severity level and message.
	•	Rotation: Logs are rotated after reaching 5MB, with up to 5 backup logs retained.
	•	Log Levels:
	•	INFO: General operational messages indicating progress.
	•	WARNING: Indications of potential issues, such as missing fields or invalid data.
	•	ERROR: Critical issues that prevent successful processing of data.

Sample Log Entries:

2025-01-13 17:03:50,132 [ERROR] Failed to process file BIG.json: Unrecognized JSON structure. Not old list, nor TypingMind style.
2025-01-13 17:03:50,133 [INFO] Moved file BIG.json to failed directory.
2025-01-13 17:03:50,193 [INFO] Database connection closed.

Error Handling

The script is equipped with robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability and data integrity.

Common Errors and Solutions
	1.	“No update (datemodified not newer)”:
	•	Cause: The record already exists in the database, and the new datemodified is not strictly greater than the existing row’s datemodified.
	•	Solution: This is expected behavior if the script is designed to only update newer records. If you wish to always update, remove or modify the WHERE conversations.datemodified < EXCLUDED.datemodified clause in the SQL.
	2.	NameError (filename not defined):
	•	Cause: filename was referenced without a local definition in the process_json_file function.
	•	Solution: The script now defines filename = os.path.basename(filepath) at the start of process_json_file, resolving the error.
	3.	Unsupported Unicode Escape Sequences (\u0000):
	•	Cause: Presence of NULL (\u0000) or other control characters in JSON strings.
	•	Solution: The script sanitizes JSON data by removing these characters before parsing and insertion.
	4.	Missing Required Fields:
	•	Cause: JSON items missing essential fields like id, title, create_time, or update_time.
	•	Solution: The script logs warnings for missing fields and skips processing those items.
	5.	Invalid UUID Format:
	•	Cause: The source or id field does not conform to UUID standards.
	•	Solution: The script can validate UUIDs (if implemented) and skip items with invalid formats, logging appropriate warnings.
	6.	Malformed JSON File:
	•	Cause: JSON file contains syntax errors or is improperly formatted.
	•	Solution: The script catches json.JSONDecodeError, logs the error, and moves the file to the failed directory for manual inspection.

Graceful Degradation
	•	Item-Level Skipping: If a particular conversation item within a JSON file encounters an error, the script logs the issue and continues processing the remaining items.
	•	File-Level Handling: If an entire JSON file is malformed or has an unrecognized structure, the script moves it to files/failed without halting the entire import process.

Logging Best Practices
	•	Detailed Messages: Logs include specific information about the nature and location of errors (e.g., item index and ID).
	•	Avoiding Sensitive Data Exposure: Logs should not contain sensitive information like database credentials.

Testing

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the Conversations Importer, it’s crucial to implement and perform thorough testing.

Unit Testing

Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components within the script.

Example: Testing Sanitization Functions

import unittest
from upload import sanitize_json, sanitize_json_string

class TestSanitizeJson(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_null_characters(self):
        input_data = {
            "content": "Hello\u0000World"
        }
        expected_output = {
            "content": "HelloWorld"
        }
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_json(input_data), expected_output)

    def test_remove_control_characters(self):
        input_data = {
            "messages": [
                {"text": "Test\u0000Message"},
                {"text": "Another\u0001Test"}
            ]
        }
        expected_output = {
            "messages": [
                {"text": "TestMessage"},
                {"text": "AnotherTest"}
            ]
        }
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_json(input_data), expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Running Tests:

python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p '*_test.py'

Ensure that test files are appropriately named and located.

Integration Testing

Test the entire import process with sample JSON files to ensure that data flows correctly from the source to the database.

Sample Test JSON File (test.json):

[
    {
        "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "title": "Test Conversation",
        "create_time": 1736233400.631032,
        "update_time": 1736233500.631032,
        "content": "This is a test conversation."
    }
]

Testing Steps:
	1.	Place test.json in files/to-process.
	2.	Run the Import Script:

python3 upload.py


	3.	Verify Logs: Ensure that the record was inserted/updated successfully.
	4.	Check the Database: Confirm that the conversation appears in the conversations table.
	5.	Validate File Movement: Ensure that test.json is moved to the processed directory.

Edge Case Testing

Test scenarios with:
	•	Missing Fields: Conversations missing title or id.
	•	Invalid UUIDs: Conversations with incorrectly formatted source or id.
	•	Malformed JSON: Files with syntax errors.
	•	Duplicate Records: Conversations that already exist in the database to test conflict resolution.
	•	TypingMind Top-Level Key: JSON that looks like:

{
  "NewKey": {
    "data": {
      "chats": [ ... ]
    }
  }
}

to ensure the script unwraps correctly.

Best Practices

1. Comprehensive Sanitization

Ensure that all JSON data is sanitized to remove any invalid or unsupported characters before processing.

Implementation:
	•	Utilize regular expressions to strip out control characters.
	•	Recursively sanitize nested JSON objects and arrays.

2. Robust Logging

Maintain detailed logs to monitor the import process and facilitate troubleshooting.

Implementation:
	•	Use RotatingFileHandler to manage log file sizes.
	•	Include timestamps, log levels, and descriptive messages.
	•	Avoid logging sensitive information.

3. Validate Data Integrity

Before inserting data into the database, validate that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

Implementation:
	•	Check for the presence of mandatory fields (id, title, create_time, update_time).
	•	Confirm that timestamps are valid (ISO8601 or Unix epoch).
	•	Ensure that UUIDs are properly formatted if required.

4. Handle Errors Gracefully

Implement error handling to prevent the script from crashing and to provide meaningful feedback.

Implementation:
	•	Use try-except blocks around critical operations.
	•	Log warnings for recoverable issues and errors for critical failures.
	•	Skip problematic items and continue processing the rest.

5. Secure Configuration

Protect sensitive information like database credentials by using environment variables and securing configuration files.

Implementation:
	•	Store credentials in a .env file and load them using python-dotenv.
	•	Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access.
	•	Exclude .env from version control (.gitignore).

6. Automate the Import Process

Schedule the import script to run at regular intervals to ensure that new data is processed promptly.

Implementation:
	•	Use cron jobs on Unix systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.
	•	Example Cron Job (Runs Every Hour):

0 * * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/scripts/upload.py >> /path/to/scripts/logs/import_cron.log 2>&1



7. Backup and Recovery

Regularly back up your PostgreSQL database to prevent data loss and facilitate recovery.

Implementation:
	•	Use pg_dump for backing up databases.
	•	Automate backups using scripts and schedule them via cron.

8. Maintain Code Quality

Ensure that the scripts are maintainable and adhere to coding standards.

Implementation:
	•	Use descriptive variable and function names.
	•	Include comprehensive documentation and comments.
	•	Implement unit tests to verify functionality.

Troubleshooting

Common Issues and Solutions
	1.	“No update (datemodified not newer)”
	•	Cause: The script found an existing row in the database with the same (title, source) and a datemodified that’s already as new or newer.
	•	Solution: By default, the script updates only if the new datemodified is strictly greater. If you want to always update, remove or modify WHERE conversations.datemodified < EXCLUDED.datemodified.
	2.	NameError (filename not defined)
	•	Cause: A reference to filename without defining it locally inside process_json_file().
	•	Solution: We now define filename = os.path.basename(filepath) in the function to avoid the error.
	3.	Unsupported Unicode Escape Sequence (\u0000)
	•	Cause: Presence of NULL (\u0000) or other control characters in JSON.
	•	Solution: The script sanitizes JSON data by removing such characters before parsing and insertion.
	4.	Malformed JSON File
	•	Cause: JSON file contains syntax errors or unrecognized structure.
	•	Solution: The script logs the json.JSONDecodeError and moves the file to files/failed. Check the file contents manually.
	5.	Top-Level Key Wrapping TypingMind Data
	•	Cause: Some TypingMind exports may introduce an extra key (e.g., "NewKey") before {"data": {"chats":[...]}}.
	•	Solution: The script auto-detects if there is a single top-level key wrapping the standard "data": {"chats": [...]}" block and unwraps it, allowing normal TypingMind logic to proceed.

Steps to Resolve Errors
	1.	Check Logs:
Review the import_json.log file located in scripts/logs/ for detailed error messages.
	2.	Inspect Failed Files:
Open JSON files in the files/failed/ directory to identify and rectify issues.
	3.	Validate JSON Structure:
Use online JSON validators or tools like jq to ensure that your JSON files are well-formed.
	4.	Ensure All Required Fields Are Present:
Verify that each conversation item includes id, title, create_time, and update_time.
	5.	Confirm Timestamps:
Make sure create_time and update_time are valid ISO8601 strings or numeric Unix epoch values.
	6.	Re-run the Script:
After addressing issues, place the corrected JSON files back into files/to-process/ and re-run the import script:

python3 upload.py

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Conversations Importer, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Operating System**: Unix-based systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) are recommended.
2. **Python**: Python 3.6 or higher installed.
3. **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL 10 or higher installed and running.
4. **Git**: Installed for cloning the repository.
5. **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for managing Python dependencies.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Conversations-Importer.git
cd Conversations-Importer
```

> Replace `yourusername` with the actual GitHub username if applicable.

### 2. Create Directory Structure

Ensure that the necessary directories exist. The following command sets up the required directories if they don’t already exist:

```bash
mkdir -p files/to-process files/processed files/failed scripts/logs
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (`Conversations-Importer/`) to store your PostgreSQL credentials securely:

```bash
touch .env
```

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following variables:

```
DB_NAME=mydb
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
DB_HOST=192.168.1.200
DB_PORT=5432
```

**Important:**

- Replace `mydb`, `myuser`, `mypassword`, and `192.168.1.200` with your actual PostgreSQL database name, username, password, and host IP address.
- Ensure that the `.env` file is not committed to version control to protect sensitive information.

### 4. Set Up the PostgreSQL Database

Create or update the `conversations` table to handle both the original and new columns used by the scripts. Connect to your PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
psql -h 192.168.1.200 -U myuser -d mydb
```

> Replace host, user, and database name as per your configuration.

Create/Update the Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    source UUID NOT NULL,
    create_time TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    datemodified TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (title, source)
);

-- Add new columns if they don't already exist
ALTER TABLE conversations
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cost numeric,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS model_id text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS model_name text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS num_messages int,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS chat_title text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS preview text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS synced_at timestamp;
```

**Explanation of Columns:**

- **id**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **title**: Title of the conversation.
- **source**: Typically a UUID representing the source (from JSON).
- **create\_time**: Timestamp when the conversation was created.
- **datemodified**: Timestamp of the last modification to the conversation.
- **data**: Entire conversation data stored as a JSONB object for flexibility.
- **cost, model\_id, model\_name, num\_messages, chat\_title, preview, synced\_at**: Additional fields for capturing TypingMind or other relevant metadata.
- **UNIQUE (title, source)**: Ensures that each combination of title and source is unique to prevent duplicates.

### 5. Install Python Dependencies

It’s recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Create a Virtual Environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv scripts/venv
```

**Activate the Virtual Environment**:

```bash
source scripts/venv/bin/activate
```

**Upgrade pip**:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Install Required Packages**:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
```

> The `psycopg2-binary` package is used to interact with PostgreSQL, and `python-dotenv` loads environment variables from the `.env` file.

---

## Usage

### Running the Import Script

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**\
   If not already activated, navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   cd Conversations-Importer/scripts
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Place JSON Files for Processing**\
   Add your JSON files containing conversation data to the `files/to-process` directory:

   ```bash
   cp /path/to/your/chatgpt-export.json ../files/to-process/
   ```

3. **Execute the Script**\
   Run the `upload.py` script to import the JSON files into PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   python3 upload.py
   ```

**Sample Output**:

```plaintext
2025-01-08 21:18:19,116 [INFO] Successfully connected to PostgreSQL.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,116 [INFO] Found 1 JSON file(s) to process.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,116 [INFO] Processing file: chatgpt-export.json
2025-01-08 21:18:19,213 [INFO] Upserted record ID 77 (source=677dedc6-29f8-8002-a841-0aecb03a80b0) at index 1.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,255 [INFO] Moved file chatgpt-export.json to processed directory.
2025-01-08 21:18:19,255 [INFO] Database connection closed.
```

### Understanding File Movements

- **Processed Files**: Successfully processed JSON files are moved from `files/to-process` to `files/processed`.
- **Failed Files**: JSON files that encounter errors during processing are moved to `files/failed` for further inspection.

## Script Details

### upload.py

The `upload.py` (or `import_json.py`) script is the core component responsible for importing JSON files into the PostgreSQL `conversations` table. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Database Connection**
   - Connects to PostgreSQL using credentials from the `.env` file.
   - Utilizes `psycopg2` for database interactions.

2. **File Processing**
   - Scans the `files/to-process` directory for JSON files.
   - Reads and sanitizes JSON data to remove invalid Unicode characters.
   - Parses the sanitized JSON string into Python objects.

3. **Data Validation & TypingMind Logic**
   - Checks if each JSON file follows the old format (list of conversation dicts) or the TypingMind format (`{"data": {"chats": [...]}}`).
   - Also detects if there’s an extra top-level key (e.g., `"NewKey"`) around the `{"data":{"chats":[...]}}` structure and unwraps it automatically.
   - Ensures each conversation has all required fields and converts timestamps.

4. **Columns & Metadata**
   - In addition to core columns (`title`, `source`, `create_time`, `datemodified`, `data`), captures:
     - `cost` (numeric)
     - `model_id` (text)
     - `model_name` (text)
     - `num_messages` (int)
     - `chat_title` (text)
     - `preview` (text)
     - `synced_at` (timestamp)

5. **Database Insertion/Update**
   - Inserts new records or updates existing ones based on the `ON CONFLICT (title, source)` clause.
   - The script logs a message like “No update (datemodified not newer)” if an existing record has an equal or more recent `datemodified`.
   - Utilizes `RETURNING id` to fetch the ID of the inserted/updated record.

6. **NameError Fix & Logging**
   - Defines `filename` within the `process_json_file` function to avoid `NameError`.
   - Maintains comprehensive logs in both the console and `scripts/logs/import_json.log`.
   - Implements log rotation to prevent log files from becoming excessively large.

**Key Functions**:

- `connect_db()`: Establishes a connection to PostgreSQL.
- `sanitize_json_string()`: Cleans the raw JSON string.
- `sanitize_json()`: Recursively sanitizes JSON objects.
- `convert_timestamp()`: Converts various timestamp formats to datetime objects.
- `process_typingmind_chat()`: Handles chats from TypingMind data format.
- `process_old_format_item()`: Handles legacy conversation data items.
- `process_json_file()`: Orchestrates the processing of individual JSON files (detects format, unwraps top-level key if needed).

### delete\_duplicates.py

> **Note**: This script was mentioned in the project structure but not detailed in the conversation. Assuming it is used to clean duplicate records based on specific criteria.

The `delete_duplicates.py` script is designed to identify and remove duplicate records from the `conversations` table. It ensures data integrity by enforcing uniqueness based on the combination of `title` and `source`.

**Key Features**:

- **Duplicate Identification**
  - Scans the `conversations` table for records sharing the same `title` and `source`.
  - Identifies duplicates based on predefined criteria.
- **Deletion Mechanism**
  - Removes duplicate entries while retaining the most recent record based on `datemodified`.
  - Utilizes SQL queries with window functions or subqueries to efficiently identify duplicates.
- **Logging**
  - Logs the number of duplicates found and deleted.
  - Records details of deleted records for auditing purposes.

**Usage**:

```bash
python3 delete_duplicates.py
```

> Ensure that this script is correctly implemented to avoid unintended data loss.

---

## Logging

Comprehensive logging is implemented to facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.

- **Log Files**
  - **Location**: `scripts/logs/import_json.log`
  - **Format**: Timestamped entries indicating the severity level and message.
  - **Rotation**: Logs are rotated after reaching 5MB, with up to 5 backup logs retained.

- **Log Levels**
  - **INFO**: General operational messages indicating progress.
  - **WARNING**: Indications of potential issues, such as missing fields or invalid data.
  - **ERROR**: Critical issues that prevent successful processing of data.

**Sample Log Entries**:

```plaintext
2025-01-13 17:03:50,132 [ERROR] Failed to process file BIG.json: Unrecognized JSON structure. Not old list, nor TypingMind style.
2025-01-13 17:03:50,133 [INFO] Moved file BIG.json to failed directory.
2025-01-13 17:03:50,193 [INFO] Database connection closed.
```

## Error Handling

The script is equipped with robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability and data integrity.

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **“No update (datemodified not newer)”**
   - **Cause**: The record already exists in the database, and the new `datemodified` is not strictly greater than the existing row’s `datemodified`.
   - **Solution**: This is expected behavior if the script is designed to only update newer records. If you wish to always update, remove or modify the `WHERE conversations.datemodified < EXCLUDED.datemodified` clause in the SQL.

2. **NameError (filename not defined)**
   - **Cause**: `filename` was referenced without a local definition in the `process_json_file` function.
   - **Solution**: The script now defines `filename = os.path.basename(filepath)` at the start of `process_json_file`, resolving the error.

3. **Unsupported Unicode Escape Sequences (\u0000)**
   - **Cause**: Presence of NULL (`\u0000`) or other control characters in JSON strings.
   - **Solution**: The script sanitizes JSON data by removing these characters before parsing and insertion.

4. **Missing Required Fields**
   - **Cause**: JSON items missing essential fields like `id`, `title`, `create_time`, or `update_time`.
   - **Solution**: The script logs warnings for missing fields and skips processing those items.

5. **Invalid UUID Format**
   - **Cause**: The `source` or `id` field does not conform to UUID standards.
   - **Solution**: The script can validate UUIDs (if implemented) and skip items with invalid formats, logging appropriate warnings.

6. **Malformed JSON File**
   - **Cause**: JSON file contains syntax errors or is improperly formatted.
   - **Solution**: The script catches `json.JSONDecodeError`, logs the error, and moves the file to the `failed` directory for manual inspection.

### Graceful Degradation

- **Item-Level Skipping**: If a particular conversation item within a JSON file encounters an error, the script logs the issue and continues processing the remaining items.
- **File-Level Handling**: If an entire JSON file is malformed or has an unrecognized structure, the script moves it to `files/failed` without halting the entire import process.

### Logging Best Practices

- **Detailed Messages**: Logs include specific information about the nature and location of errors (e.g., item index and ID).
- **Avoiding Sensitive Data Exposure**: Logs should not contain sensitive information like database credentials.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the Conversations Importer, it’s crucial to implement and perform thorough testing.

### Unit Testing

Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components within the script.

**Example: Testing Sanitization Functions**

```python
import unittest
from upload import sanitize_json, sanitize_json_string

class TestSanitizeJson(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_null_characters(self):
        input_data = {
            "content": "Hello\u0000World"
        }
        expected_output = {
            "content": "HelloWorld"
        }
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_json(input_data), expected_output)

    def test_remove_control_characters(self):
        input_data = {
            "messages": [
                {"text": "Test\u0000Message"},
                {"text": "Another\u0001Test"}
            ]
        }
        expected_output = {
            "messages": [
                {"text": "TestMessage"},
                {"text": "AnotherTest"}
            ]
        }
        self.assertEqual(sanitize_json(input_data), expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Running Tests**:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p '*_test.py'
```

> Ensure that test files are appropriately named and located.

### Integration Testing

Test the entire import process with sample JSON files to ensure that data flows correctly from the source to the database.

**Sample Test JSON File (`test.json`):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "title": "Test Conversation",
    "create_time": 1736233400.631032,
    "update_time": 1736233500.631032,
    "content": "This is a test conversation."
  }
]
```

**Testing Steps**:

1. Place `test.json` in `files/to-process`.

2. Run the Import Script:

   ```bash
   python3 upload.py
   ```

3. **Verify Logs**: Ensure that the record was inserted/updated successfully.

4. **Check the Database**: Confirm that the conversation appears in the `conversations` table.

5. **Validate File Movement**: Ensure that `test.json` is moved to the `processed` directory.

### Edge Case Testing

Test scenarios with:

- **Missing Fields**: Conversations missing `title` or `id`.
- **Invalid UUIDs**: Conversations with incorrectly formatted `source` or `id`.
- **Malformed JSON**: Files with syntax errors.
- **Duplicate Records**: Conversations that already exist in the database to test conflict resolution.
- **TypingMind Top-Level Key**: JSON that looks like:

  ```json
  {
    "NewKey": {
      "data": {
        "chats": [ ... ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  to ensure the script unwraps correctly.

## Best Practices

### 1. Comprehensive Sanitization

Ensure that all JSON data is sanitized to remove any invalid or unsupported characters before processing.

- **Implementation**:
  - Utilize regular expressions to strip out control characters.
  - Recursively sanitize nested JSON objects and arrays.

### 2. Robust Logging

Maintain detailed logs to monitor the import process and facilitate troubleshooting.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use `RotatingFileHandler` to manage log file sizes.
  - Include timestamps, log levels, and descriptive messages.
  - Avoid logging sensitive information.

### 3. Validate Data Integrity

Before inserting data into the database, validate that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

- **Implementation**:
  - Check for the presence of mandatory fields (`id`, `title`, `create_time`, `update_time`).
  - Confirm that timestamps are valid (ISO8601 or Unix epoch).
  - Ensure that UUIDs are properly formatted if required.

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully

Implement error handling to prevent the script from crashing and to provide meaningful feedback.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use `try-except` blocks around critical operations.
  - Log warnings for recoverable issues and errors for critical failures.
  - Skip problematic items and continue processing the rest.

### 5. Secure Configuration

Protect sensitive information like database credentials by using environment variables and securing configuration files.

- **Implementation**:
  - Store credentials in a `.env` file and load them using `python-dotenv`.
  - Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access.
  - Exclude `.env` from version control (`.gitignore`).

### 6. Automate the Import Process

Schedule the import script to run at regular intervals to ensure that new data is processed promptly.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use cron jobs on Unix systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.
  - **Example Cron Job (Runs Every Hour)**:

    ```bash
    0 * * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/scripts/upload.py >> /path/to/scripts/logs/import_cron.log 2>&1
    ```

### 7. Backup and Recovery

Regularly back up your PostgreSQL database to prevent data loss and facilitate recovery.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use `pg_dump` for backing up databases.
  - Automate backups using scripts and schedule them via cron.

### 8. Maintain Code Quality

Ensure that the scripts are maintainable and adhere to coding standards.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use descriptive variable and function names.
  - Include comprehensive documentation and comments.
  - Implement unit tests to verify functionality.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **“No update (datemodified not newer)”**
   - **Cause**: The script found an existing row in the database with the same (`title`, `source`) and a `datemodified` that’s already as new or newer.
   - **Solution**: By default, the script updates only if the new `datemodified` is strictly greater. If you want to always update, remove or modify `WHERE conversations.datemodified < EXCLUDED.datemodified`.

2. **NameError (filename not defined)**
   - **Cause**: A reference to `filename` without defining it locally inside `process_json_file()`.
   - **Solution**: We now define `filename = os.path.basename(filepath)` in the function to avoid the error.

3. **Unsupported Unicode Escape Sequence (\u0000)**
   - **Cause**: Presence of NULL (`\u0000`) or other control characters in JSON.
   - **Solution**: The script sanitizes JSON data by removing such characters before parsing and insertion.

4. **Malformed JSON File**
   - **Cause**: JSON file contains syntax errors or unrecognized structure.
   - **Solution**: The script logs the `json.JSONDecodeError` and moves the file to `files/failed`. Check the file contents manually.

5. **Top-Level Key Wrapping TypingMind Data**
   - **Cause**: Some TypingMind exports may introduce an extra key (e.g., `"NewKey"`) before `{"data": {"chats":[...]}}`.
   - **Solution**: The script auto-detects if there is a single top-level key wrapping the standard `"data": {"chats": [...]}"` block and unwraps it, allowing normal TypingMind logic to proceed.

### Steps to Resolve Errors

1. **Check Logs**: Review the `import_json.log` file located in `scripts/logs/` for detailed error messages.
2. **Inspect Failed Files**: Open JSON files in the `files/failed/` directory to identify and rectify issues.
3. **Validate JSON Structure**: Use online JSON validators or tools like `jq` to ensure that your JSON files are well-formed.
4. **Ensure All Required Fields Are Present**: Verify that each conversation item includes `id`, `title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`.
5. **Confirm Timestamps**: Make sure `create_time` and `update_time` are valid ISO8601 strings or numeric Unix epoch values.
6. **Re-run the Script**: After addressing issues, place the corrected JSON files back into `files/to-process/` and re-run:

   ```bash
   python3 upload.py
   ```
