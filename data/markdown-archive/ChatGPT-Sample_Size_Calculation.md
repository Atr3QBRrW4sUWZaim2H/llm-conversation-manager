generate a csv or formula I can use to calculate all possible values of this

I'll generate a CSV file containing all possible values for sample size calculation based on your given parameters:

- **Baseline Conversion Rate**: 1.5%
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: 10%
- **Statistical Significance**: 95%

The calculation will include different values of power (typically 80% and 90%) and variations in traffic allocation (50/50 split and others). I'll generate the file now.

It looks like there's an issue with importing `proportion_effectsize`. I'll use an alternative method to calculate the required sample sizes and generate the CSV again.

It looks like some variables were lost due to the previous error. I'll redefine everything and generate the CSV again.

I have updated the script to allow input for baseline conversion rate, predicted impact of the experiment (MDE), statistical significance, and the number of test groups. You can download the updated sample size calculations using the link below:

what does power mean here and how should I use it within the context of this data. is this the same as 90% significance?

Great question! **Power** in the context of A/B testing (or any hypothesis testing) refers to the probability of correctly detecting a real effect when it actually exists. It is different from statistical significance.

### **Power vs. Significance**

- **Statistical Significance (α, Alpha Level)**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (false positive or Type I error). A common value is **5% (0.05)**, meaning you accept a **5% chance of incorrectly detecting an effect when there is none**.
- **Power (1 - β, Beta Level)**: The probability of **correctly detecting a true effect** (true positive). A common power level is **80% (0.8) or 90% (0.9)**, meaning you have an **80-90% chance of detecting an effect if one actually exists**. It is related to the **false negative rate (β)**, where **higher power reduces the risk of missing a true effect**.

### **How to Use Power in This Context**

- **Higher power (e.g., 90%)** requires a **larger sample size** but gives you a better chance of detecting a real effect.
- **Lower power (e.g., 80%)** means a smaller sample size but a higher risk of missing an effect.
- In this dataset, we calculated **sample sizes for both 80% and 90% power** to help you decide based on the **trade-off between statistical rigor and resource constraints**.

### **Is Power the Same as 90% Significance?**

**No, power is NOT the same as 90% significance.**

- **90% significance (α = 0.10)** means you allow a **10% chance of a false positive**.
- **90% power** means you have a **90% chance of detecting a true effect if it exists**.
- These are **separate but complementary** concepts.

### **How to Decide on Power Level?**

- **80% Power** (Standard) → Good balance of sample size and reliability.
- **90% Power** → More confidence in detecting an effect, but **requires more traffic/data**.
- **95%+ Power** → Very rigorous but impractical for many experiments (huge sample sizes).

Would you like me to run another calculation with different power levels or help interpret the trade-offs for your specific case?
