It looks like you’re trying to change into **run\_rag.sh** as if it were a directory, but it’s actually a shell script (a file). That’s why you’re getting the error:

```
bash: cd: ./run_rag.sh: Not a directory
```

### How to fix this

1. **If you want to run the script**:
   - First, make sure it’s executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x run_rag.sh
     ```
   - Then run it with:
     ```bash
     ./run_rag.sh
     ```
   or
   ```bash
   bash run_rag.sh
   ```

2. **If you want to see or edit the script’s contents**, open it with a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano run_rag.sh
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   vi run_rag.sh
   ```
   (Choose whichever editor you’re comfortable with.)

3. **If you actually meant to change directories**, make sure you specify a valid directory path. For example:
   ```bash
   cd ~/langchain/src
   ```
   if **src** is a directory.

### Extra Context (Linking to AI/RAG Concepts)

Since the file is named `run_rag.sh`, it might be a script to **run a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, commonly used in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. In RAG workflows:

- You typically have a **retriever** (e.g., a vector store) that finds relevant pieces of information from a document store or external data source.
- Then the **LLM** is prompted with those retrieved chunks to generate more informed answers.

Running scripts like `run_rag.sh` often involves:

- Setting up environment variables,
- Launching a local vector database,
- Kicking off a Python script that uses a framework (like **LangChain** or **Haystack**) for retrieval and generation.

If you’re experimenting with RAG in **LangChain**, keep in mind:

- **Chaining** is used to link different components (retriever, LLM, prompt templates, etc.).
- **Memory** can be managed for multi-turn conversations.

So, in your current workflow, once you’ve made the script executable, run it, and watch out for logs about how your pipeline is set up or if it’s prompting you for any inputs to your language model. This can help you debug or refine your RAG setup effectively.
