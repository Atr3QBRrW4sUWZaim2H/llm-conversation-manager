I booked a Shinkansen ticket from Tokyo station but it’s easier for me to board at Shinagawa. Do I need to change my ticket or can I just board at Shinagawa

If you booked a **non-reserved seat (自由席, jiyū-seki)** on the Shinkansen, you can board at **Shinagawa Station** without changing your ticket.

If you have a **reserved seat (指定席, shitei-seki)** and your ticket explicitly states Tokyo Station as the departure point, you technically need to change your ticket to reflect **Shinagawa as the new departure station**. However, in practice, many conductors may not mind as long as you're on the correct train and in your assigned seat.

To be safe, you can visit a JR ticket counter (Midori no Madoguchi) or use a ticket machine before boarding to make the change. If your ticket is part of a **Japan Rail Pass** reservation, you should rebook at a JR office.

Would you like help with how to change it at the machine or counter?

**Short answer:**\
It’s best to have your departure station on the ticket match where you actually board. Officially, that means you should change your tickets to depart from Shinagawa. However, in practice, some travelers simply board at Shinagawa with their Tokyo–(destination) tickets (especially if the fare is the same or very close) without issue. Still, to be **fully compliant** and avoid any potential problems, you’ll want to update your tickets.

## Why You (Officially) Need to Change the Tickets

1. **Green Car reservations are seat-specific**
   - When you book Green Car (グリーン車) seats, your ticket states your departure station (e.g., Tokyo) and train number, along with a specific seat assignment.
   - If you board at Shinagawa with a Tokyo-departure ticket, you’re technically “missing” the first part of the journey. Japan Rail (JR) rules say that if you skip any part of the route specified on a ticket, the remaining portion can become invalid.

2. **Fares can differ slightly**
   - Even though Tokyo and Shinagawa are relatively close, the base fare can be a bit cheaper from Shinagawa. This difference may or may not matter to the conductor, but officially, the fare you pay should match your actual trip.

3. **Ease of mind**
   - Changing your ticket at a **Midori no Madoguchi** (JR ticket office) or a compatible ticket machine only takes a few minutes. It ensures you won’t run into any unexpected issues if there’s a ticket check.

## What Happens If You Don’t Change It?

- **Many conductors may not mind** as long as your seat is correctly reserved for that train and you’re traveling a “shorter” route.
- **However**, there’s a small chance you could be asked to either pay the difference or have them reissue a new ticket on the train (which can be a hassle).

## How to Change Your Tickets

1. **At a JR Ticket Counter (Midori no Madoguchi):**
   - Bring your current tickets (both the base fare ticket and the Green Car reservation ticket).
   - Ask staff to reissue them from **Shinagawa to \[destination]** instead of **Tokyo to \[destination].**
   - They will calculate if there’s any difference in price. Often it’s minimal—sometimes you might even get a small refund.

2. **At a Ticket Machine (if supported):**
   - Not all machines can handle complex changes, but look for one labeled “みどりの窓口” or “Reserved Seat Ticket Machine.”
   - Select “Change reservation” or “Ticket change” (乗車変更) and follow the on-screen prompts.
   - If you have trouble, just step over to the ticket counter; staff are very used to these requests.

## Bottom Line

- **Recommended**: Stop by a ticket counter and change the departure station to Shinagawa so everything matches.
- **Possible alternative**: Board at Shinagawa with your original tickets from Tokyo, but understand that there’s a small risk of being asked to settle any fare difference or clarify why you didn’t board at Tokyo.

Since you have **Green Car tickets**, you’re already using premium seats. A quick visit to reissue your tickets keeps everything officially correct, so you can relax and enjoy the ride in the Green Car without any ticket complications.
