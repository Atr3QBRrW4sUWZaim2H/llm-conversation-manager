# CRO Strategy for Premium

#### You:
<time datetime="2025-01-24T20:30:33.950Z" title="1/25/2025, 5:30:33 AM">05:30</time>

i'm a product manager at indeed. we are launching a paid app in canada called premium and we are launching the same set of features in the US, though in the US people have to enter a minimum amount of data to unlock access to the featrures.

i am leading conversion rate optimization for both products. the fundamentals for user acquisition for both products. i'd like my team to focus on user acquisition for the paid product first, so that our team can start producing revenue which  is good for optics. 

my team is mostly from enterprise software and haven't worked on user acqusiiton or true conversion rate optimization. i have some basic notes about how I am thinking about the problem space below.  

help me organize my notes into a coherent document for my teams that help them understand the problem space and how we should approach it

Below is an example of how you could transform your raw notes into a clear, cohesive document for your team. This structure helps clarify the problem space, the business context, the goals, and the tactical approach—all while introducing key conversion rate optimization (CRO) concepts that team members with an enterprise software background may not be familiar with. Feel free to adjust or elaborate to match your team’s specific workflows and terminology.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Background

- **Product**: Indeed Premium (Paid App in Canada) + feature-gated model in the U.S.
- **Why Focus on User Acquisition for Premium First?**
  - Generates direct revenue.
  - Demonstrates value of the new product quickly (“good for optics”).
  - Builds momentum and internal alignment by showing tangible success.

### 1.2 Purpose of This Document

- Provide a structured overview of our Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) and user acquisition strategies.
- Clarify immediate priorities (focusing on Premium sign-ups).
- Guide the team—largely from an enterprise software background—through key CRO concepts, tactics, and next steps.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

We want to:

- Increase the number of job seekers who enter the **Free Trial** for Indeed Premium.
- Improve the conversion rate from **Free** to **Free Trial**, and subsequently from **Free Trial** to **Paying** subscribers.

**Key Metric**: The **Free → Free Trial Conversion Rate** is our most important KPI for the next three months.

---

## 3. Goals and Impact

1. **Increase Impressions**
   - Ensure more job seekers see Premium promotions and calls-to-action (CTAs) across high-traffic areas.

2. **Increase Conversion Rate**
   - Once they see the Premium promotions, improve how many of them actually sign up for the free trial.

3. **Revenue Generation**
   - A percentage (1–2%) of free trial users will convert into paying users, thus driving direct revenue.

---

## 4. Understanding Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

### 4.1 What is CRO?

**Conversion Rate Optimization** is the systematic process of:

1. **Identifying** where users drop off in the funnel (Free → Free Trial → Paid).
2. **Hypothesizing** improvements (e.g., changes in messaging, layout, incentives).
3. **Testing** those improvements (e.g., A/B tests).
4. **Iterating** based on insights.

For team members coming from enterprise software, think of CRO as an iterative, data-driven approach to **refine the user journey** so that more users complete our desired action: **signing up for Premium**.

### 4.2 User Acquisition vs. Enterprise Sales

- **Enterprise Sales** often involves direct outreach, demos, and relationship building with a smaller set of prospects.
- **User Acquisition** (for a consumer-facing product like Indeed’s Premium) focuses on maximizing impressions and conversions at scale. This includes:
  - **Promotions on high-traffic pages** (SERP, MyJobs, Profile, etc.).
  - **Email/Push notifications** to re-engage or inform potential users.
  - **In-app triggers** when a user encounters a feature that’s currently locked behind Premium.

---

## 5. Current Implementation (Today)

### 5.1 Existing Promos

- **Homepage**: Promo for Premium.
- **MyJobs**: Promo surfaces but may be underutilized.
- **View Job**: Promo message while viewing a specific job posting.

### 5.2 Notifications & Communications

- **Intro email** for new Premium users.
- **Subscribed email** for ongoing tips or feature highlights.
- **Unsubscribe email** to clarify what’s lost when opting out.

### 5.3 Missing Opportunities

- **“Top Applicant” Feature**: Currently not promoted on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page).
- **“Top Choice” Feature**: No in-flow promotion during the application process.
- **WVMP (“Who Viewed My Profile”)**: Not linked to a Premium upsell on the profile page.

**Action**: Add promotional messaging/prompt at every possible feature entry point. Examples:

- **SERP**: Add “Top Applicant” promo.
- **Apply Flow**: Insert “Top Choice” promo mid-process.
- **Profile**: Show WVMP-based Premium upsell banner or teaser.

---

## 6. Future Opportunities

### 6.1 Additional Placements (Off-Site + On-Site)

- **Off-Site**: Push notifications, email re-engagement campaigns, possible SEM (Search Engine Marketing) or display ads (pending budget and strategy).
- **On-Site**:
  - **In-line promo cards** within feed or job listings.
  - **Banner promos** on relevant pages (e.g., Profile, MyJobs).
  - **“Locked” or “Blurred” Premium features** that users can preview but need to upgrade to unlock.

### 6.2 Design + Content

- **Banner and Teaser Approaches**: Visual cues that a feature is locked. For example, partial blur or overlay with a clear CTA to learn more about Premium.
- **Intermittent Reveal**: Show glimpses of Premium features, prompting users to “Upgrade to see more.”
- **Content Testing**:
  - **Value Proposition Order**: Which benefit resonates most? (E.g., “Top Applicant,” “Who Viewed My Profile,” “Job Application Insights.”)
  - **New Messaging**: Try different headlines, sub-headers, and CTAs.
  - **Degradation Testing**: What if we remove certain content or features to see if the “fear of missing out” or the absence of a convenience drives sign-ups?

---

## 7. Strategy & Roadmap

### 7.1 Increase Impressions

1. **Offsite Promotion**:
   - Send notifications (push, email) targeting users who viewed or saved jobs but haven’t tried Premium.
   - Potentially leverage SEM or display ads for broader reach (if budget permits).

2. **Onsite Promotion**:
   - Identify **high-impression surface areas** (SERP is a priority given its traffic volume).
   - Ensure existing placements (Homepage, MyJobs, View Job) have maximum possible impression share.
   - Explore new placements within the user workflow.

### 7.2 Increase Conversion Rate

1. **Test Value Props**:
   - Existing content (like “Top Applicant” or “Top Choice”) can be reordered, reworded, or re-emphasized to increase sign-ups.
2. **Fake Door Tests**:
   - Show new Premium features as locked to gauge potential interest before fully building them out.
3. **Contextual Integrations**:
   - Surface Premium benefits exactly when they’re most relevant (e.g., mid-apply flow for “Top Choice”).
4. **A/B Testing**:
   - Continuously try different headlines, calls-to-action, and visuals to see what resonates.

---

## 8. Next Steps & Ownership

- **Ashwin Kiran Pisipati**
  1. Add “Top Applicant” promo to SERP.
  2. Add “Top Choice” promo within the application flow.
  3. Integrate WVMP promo into the Profile page.
     - *Note*: The mobile profile team is aware and awaiting our content/design updates.

- **Chelsea Singer**
  1. Update SERP/Feed promo content to highlight “Top Applicant.”
  2. Refresh bottom-sheet upsell messaging around “Top Applicant” to increase enticement.
  3. Collaborate with Morgan on design iterations as needed.

- **Morgan (Design)**
  - Pair with Chelsea to create and refine promo banners, in-feed cards, or locked-feature visuals.

### 8.1 Timeline

1. **Immediate** (1–2 weeks):
   - Implement “Top Applicant” promo on SERP.
   - Update bottom-sheet upsell with new content.
   - Begin design prototypes for “blurred/locked” features.

2. **Short-Term** (2–4 weeks):
   - Launch first wave of A/B tests (value prop emphasis, CTA text).
   - Add “Top Choice” promo to apply flow.
   - Activate WVMP upsell on Profile.

3. **Long-Term** (1–3 months):
   - Explore deeper off-site campaigns (push, email, ads).
   - Evaluate new features (fake door tests).
   - Assess and refine conversions at each step from Free → Free Trial → Paid.

---

## 9. Conclusion

By systematically increasing impressions and optimizing each step in the conversion funnel, we aim to grow Free Trial sign-ups for Indeed Premium and ultimately drive revenue. This approach hinges on:

- Strategically placing promotions where users naturally engage.
- Testing and refining our messaging and design.
- Continuously iterating based on data-driven insights.

For our team, especially those new to user acquisition and CRO, the key is to remain **experimental, hypothesis-driven, and user-centric**. Each test is an opportunity to learn and refine. Through collaboration—coordinating design, content, and product changes—we can quickly determine which tactics yield the best results and scale them accordingly.

great. how that you understand the project. help me think about the core concepts.
- the product in the US is called "pro"
- how can we better highlight the various dimensions we can experiment on, like the format of acquisition promos, the text, design, context, modality, etc. i want to help people think creatively about ways to entice job seekers to purchase that feel more natural than a simple promo image

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-24T20:37:13.037Z" title="1/25/2025, 5:37:13 AM">05:37</time>

Below is a framework for brainstorming and experimenting with different ways to highlight **Pro** in the U.S. (and Premium in Canada). By expanding on the various dimensions of acquisition messaging—**format**, **text**, **design**, **context**, and **modality**—you can help the team approach user acquisition more creatively, and in a way that feels organic to the job seeker experience.

---

## 1. Format (How & Where We Show It)

Experiment with different **formats** of in-product or off-site promos. Traditional “promo images” aren’t the only way to entice users.

1. **Inline Cards / Teasers**
   - Embed subtle cards directly in the job feed or search results (SERP).
   - Example: “Discover how you rank for this job—unlock with Pro.”
   - Why it feels natural: Appears at a point in the workflow where the user is already engaged with job content.

2. **Locked / Blurred Features**
   - Show a “preview” of exclusive Pro features that are blurred out until the user upgrades.
   - Example: “You’d be in the Top 5 applicants—blurred data below.”
   - Why it feels natural: The user sees immediate potential value but must unlock it by purchasing.

3. **In-flow Messages**
   - Insert prompts in the **apply flow** or the job detail page, seamlessly integrated with the user’s next step.
   - Example: “Ready to stand out? Pro subscribers are first in line for employers.”
   - Why it feels natural: Contextual to a user’s action (applying for a job).

4. **Banners & Pop-ups**
   - If used, make them minimal and well-timed (e.g., only after a user has taken a key action or shown interest).
   - Example: A small banner at the top of My Jobs: “Track your application rank with Pro—learn more.”
   - Why it feels natural: Provides a gentle nudge without blocking the user from completing their goal.

---

## 2. Text (Messaging & Copy)

**Copywriting** is a powerful lever. Test different variants of headlines, CTAs, and value proposition statements.

1. **Value Proposition Order**
   - Experiment with emphasizing “Top Applicant” vs. “Who Viewed My Profile” vs. “Faster Hiring” first.
   - Why it matters: Different job seekers might respond more strongly to different aspects of Pro.

2. **Tone & Style**
   - Casual vs. Professional vs. Urgent
   - Example: “Jump to the top of the list” vs. “Show recruiters you mean business.”
   - Why it matters: Aligning tone with user context can boost resonance and trust.

3. **Emotional Triggers**
   - Fear of missing out: “Don’t miss your dream job—unlock Pro features.”
   - Positive aspiration: “Level up your job search—Pro can help you stand out.”
   - Why it matters: Different emotional appeals can significantly alter sign-up behavior.

4. **Clarity & Specificity**
   - “See how many employers viewed your application in the past 24 hours” (vs. a vague “Track your applications!”).
   - Why it feels natural: Specific claims or data points assure users of tangible benefit.

---

## 3. Design (Visual Elements & Layout)

Visual design can make or break the impact of your messaging. Small design tweaks can lead to big conversion lifts.

1. **Minimalist vs. Bold**
   - Test subtle icons and small text vs. eye-catching colors or animations.
   - Why it matters: Some users prefer a clean, non-intrusive interface, while others respond better to high-contrast calls to action.

2. **Use of Familiar UI Patterns**
   - Tooltips, progress bars, highlight boxes.
   - Example: A tooltip in the SERP that says, “Unlock your applicant ranking with Pro.”
   - Why it feels natural: Familiar patterns blend smoothly into the user’s mental model of the site.

3. **Intentional Use of Color**
   - Pro branding could be a distinct color, drawing attention without clashing with Indeed’s brand identity.
   - Why it matters: A consistent color or icon for Pro can create quick recognition across different surfaces.

4. **Responsive & Mobile-Friendly**
   - Ensure the design is optimized for mobile since many job seekers apply on the go.
   - Why it feels natural: A frictionless mobile experience feels less “promo” and more integrated into the user journey.

---

## 4. Context (Timing & Relevancy)

Well-timed, context-driven prompts resonate more than generic advertisements.

1. **User State/Signals**
   - Show Pro upsells after a user applies to their 3rd or 5th job, signifying higher intent.
   - Example: “You’ve applied for 3 jobs today—ready to see where you stand?”
   - Why it feels natural: Ties the offer to a specific user milestone.

2. **Relevance to the Job Search Stage**
   - Early Search Stage: Focus on features that help users discover or rank for better-fit roles.
   - Post-Application Stage: Highlight tools that track application progress or interest from employers.
   - Why it matters: Different Pro features have different relevance depending on how far into the funnel the user is.

3. **Behavior-Based Personalization**
   - If a user consistently views salary data or company reviews, highlight Pro features that give deeper insights.
   - Why it feels natural: Feels like an assistive resource, rather than a random product pitch.

---

## 5. Modality (Channels & Delivery Methods)

Consider how the message is delivered—email, push notification, in-app, etc.—and optimize each channel’s cadence.

1. **Email**
   - Onboarding series: “3 Ways Pro Helps You Land Interviews Faster.”
   - Re-engagement series: “Haven’t visited in a while? Pro can help you pick up where you left off.”
   - Why it feels natural: If aligned with user’s job-search frequency and not overly spammy.

2. **Push Notifications**
   - Mobile push: “10 employers viewed your profile this week—see how you rank with Pro.”
   - Timing is crucial—send during peak job search hours or after a user saves/applies for a job.
   - Why it feels natural: Tied to a real-time event or milestone, increasing relevance.

3. **On-Site / In-App**
   - In-Session Nudges: Modal or banner triggered after a key action.
   - Why it works: Captures user attention while they are actively job searching.

4. **Off-Site Ads / Retargeting**
   - If exploring external marketing (SEM, social), highlight your biggest feature differentiators.
   - Why it might feel natural: If the user already visited Indeed and sees a retargeted ad highlighting Pro benefits they just missed.

---

## 6. Putting It All Together: Creative Enticements for Pro

Below are a few combined examples that illustrate how these dimensions can work in tandem:

1. **Contextual, Inline Promo (Format + Context + Design)**
   - A small card within the job listing that says:\
     “Employers love quick responses. Upgrade to **Pro** and see how your response rate compares to top candidates.”
   - **Why it’s natural**: It’s embedded at the exact moment the user is deciding to apply.

2. **Blurred Insights on Profile (Design + Text)**
   - The user sees a partially blurred section showing how many employers have looked at their profile in the past week.
   - The text might say: “Unlock your weekly profile views with **Pro**—Stay ahead in your job search!”
   - **Why it’s natural**: It leverages curiosity and the user’s immediate desire for that information.

3. **Milestone Trigger (Context + Modality)**
   - After applying to 5 jobs, the user receives an email (or a gentle in-app message) stating: “You’ve been busy! Let **Pro** help you track which employers are most interested.”
   - **Why it’s natural**: Ties directly to user behavior, offering a solution to a likely pain point.

4. **Personalized CTA (Text + Context)**
   - If a user has primarily searched for senior-level roles, highlight how Pro can help them stand out in competitive fields: “Compete with other senior-level applicants—Pro helps you showcase your expertise.”
   - **Why it’s natural**: Speaks directly to the user’s ambition and the challenges of applying for higher-level jobs.

---

## 7. Guiding Principles

1. **User-Centric**: Always ask, “Does this add value to the user’s journey right now?”
2. **Test & Learn**: Use A/B and multivariate testing to identify which combinations of format, text, design, context, and modality perform best.
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Small, incremental improvements can compound into significant conversion lifts over time.
4. **Maintain Trust**: Aggressive or misleading promos can backfire. Keep the tone transparent and user-benefit-oriented.

---

### Final Thoughts

By highlighting these **dimensions of experimentation**—**format**, **text**, **design**, **context**, and **modality**—your team can move beyond simple banner ads or promo images. The goal is to **organically integrate Pro** into the job seeker’s workflow, making the upgrade feel like a natural extension of the value Indeed already provides.

This structured approach also fosters **creativity** and **experimentation**: teams can brainstorm new ideas under each dimension, run tests, and iteratively refine what resonates most with job seekers. Over time, you’ll develop a rich set of winning strategies that effectively communicate Pro’s benefits and drive sustainable conversion and revenue growth.

<time datetime="2025-01-24T20:37:45.650Z" title="1/25/2025, 5:37:45 AM">05:37</time>

review these dimensions. think about user acquisition for a new product within a larger enterprise ecosystem. what other dimensions can we experiment on?

#### ChatGPT:
<time datetime="2025-01-24T20:38:06.712Z" title="1/25/2025, 5:38:06 AM">05:38</time>

Below is an expanded set of **dimensions** to consider when experimenting with user acquisition for a new product (e.g., “Pro” or “Premium”) within a larger enterprise ecosystem. These go beyond the usual suspects (format, text, design, context, modality) and can help your team brainstorm additional avenues for optimization.

---

## 1. Pricing & Incentives

1. **Pricing Tiers**
   - Experiment with multiple subscription plans, add-ons, or bundled pricing options within the Indeed ecosystem.
   - **Example**: Offer a basic “Pro Lite” at a lower price with fewer features, or a premium “Pro+” tier that includes extra services.

2. **Free Trials / Intro Offers**
   - Test different trial durations (7-day vs. 14-day) or limited-time discounts.
   - **Why it matters**: Adjusting incentives might drastically shift user uptake without requiring changes to core features.

3. **Bundling with Existing Products**
   - Combine Pro with other Indeed services (e.g., Resume Review, Career Coaching) for a special package rate.
   - **Why it feels natural**: Leverage the existing product ecosystem to offer more value in a single package.

---

## 2. Onboarding & Signup Flow

1. **Step-by-Step vs. Single-Step Onboarding**
   - Some users prefer a quick sign-up, while others might convert better if each benefit is explained in a guided flow.
   - **Example**: “Learn how Pro helps you find jobs faster. Let’s set up your Pro preferences…”

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Reveal Pro features gradually during onboarding.
   - **Why it works**: It reduces upfront friction and information overload, letting users absorb each benefit at the right moment.

3. **Friction Reduction**
   - Streamline sign-up forms, or leverage existing Indeed user data to auto-fill certain fields.
   - **Why it’s important**: Each extra field or click can cause drop-offs, especially in a large ecosystem.

---

## 3. Personalization & Targeting

1. **User Segmentation**
   - Tailor the messaging based on user types (e.g., recent grads, career switchers, executive-level seekers).
   - **Why it matters**: A one-size-fits-all pitch can miss the mark; personalized calls-to-action can resonate more deeply.

2. **Behavior-Based Recommendations**
   - If a user applies to many jobs in a short span, highlight features that help manage or track multiple applications.
   - **Why it’s natural**: Aligns Pro’s benefits with a demonstrated user need.

3. **Adaptive Content**
   - Show different upsells in real time, depending on which features the user has (or hasn’t) interacted with.
   - **Example**: If they never used “Who Viewed My Profile,” focus on “Top Applicant” first.

---

## 4. Trust, Social Proof & Credibility

1. **Testimonials & Ratings**
   - Incorporate real user testimonials or success stories from people who used Pro to land a job.
   - **Why it works**: Hearing it from peers can build confidence in new users.

2. **Employer Endorsements**
   - If employers highlight that Pro users stand out, showcase quotes or badges reflecting this employer preference.
   - **Why it’s natural**: Strengthens the direct correlation between purchasing Pro and getting employer attention.

3. **Certifications or External Badges**
   - Could Pro tie in with recognized certifications or skill verifications to highlight user credibility?
   - **Why it adds value**: Leverages the broader professional ecosystem to amplify trust.

---

## 5. Timing & Frequency

1. **Event-Based Triggers**
   - Prompt an upsell when a user reaches a milestone: “You’ve viewed 10 job postings—see which ones you qualify for at a glance with Pro.”
   - **Why it’s natural**: Aligns the offer with a relevant moment in the user journey.

2. **Seasonality & Industry Cycles**
   - Tailor promos around hiring spikes in certain industries or calendar periods (e.g., New Year’s career resolutions).
   - **Why it works**: Timely, seasonal offers can amplify urgency and relevance.

3. **Frequency Capping**
   - Limit how often users see Pro ads or notifications to prevent fatigue.
   - **Why it’s important**: Reduces annoyance and preserves brand trust within a larger enterprise ecosystem.

---

## 6. Ecosystem Synergies & Cross-Promotion

1. **Referrals & Loyalty Programs**
   - Introduce a “Refer a Friend” bonus where existing Pro users can earn credits or extended subscriptions for each successful referral.
   - **Why it fits**: Harnesses word-of-mouth within the Indeed user base.

2. **Partner Integrations**
   - If Indeed is integrated with other enterprise tools (e.g., HR systems or ATS platforms), highlight how Pro’s insights sync across them.
   - **Why it’s strategic**: Showcases the added benefits of being in a cohesive ecosystem.

3. **Cross-Selling Within Indeed**
   - If a user is exploring another paid Indeed feature (like sponsored job postings from an employer side), cross-promote Pro if relevant.
   - **Why it works**: Maximizes the enterprise ecosystem, reinforcing brand synergy and deepening user adoption.

---

## 7. Gamification & Engagement Loops

1. **Progress Bars & Badges**
   - Reward Pro users with profile completeness badges or job-search achievement badges.
   - **Why it’s engaging**: Gamification taps into intrinsic motivation (status, achievement).

2. **Challenges & Leaderboards**
   - A stretch idea: show how a user’s job search “score” ranks among peers (anonymously) if they opt-in to compare.
   - **Why it might work**: Adds a friendly competitive angle, though it must be handled carefully to avoid discouraging lower-performing users.

3. **Milestone Rewards**
   - Offer small perks or extended access to advanced features for consistent usage of Pro.
   - **Why it encourages retention**: Encourages daily or weekly re-engagement with the product.

---

## 8. Analytics & Feedback Loops

1. **Attribution Experiments**
   - Track which channel or promo led to a conversion—SERP card vs. email vs. push notification—and iterate.
   - **Why it’s crucial**: Pinpointing which dimension drives the highest ROI helps you focus resources effectively.

2. **Continuous Feedback**
   - Present short surveys or ask for a quick rating after a user interacts with Pro features.
   - **Why it helps**: Real-time feedback can guide iterative feature improvements and new test ideas.

3. **Data-Driven Iteration**
   - Adopt a standard testing framework (A/B or multivariate) for each dimension.
   - **Why it matters**: A scientific approach ensures creative ideas are backed by measurable outcomes.

---

## 9. Putting It All Together: A Holistic Experiment Matrix

Consider creating a **matrix** where each row is a user segment or funnel stage, and each column represents a dimension (Pricing, Onboarding, Personalization, etc.). Within each cell, brainstorm a **targeted test**. For example:

- **Row (User Segment)**: “Early Career,” “Mid-Career Switchers,” “Executives.”
- **Column (Dimension)**: “Pricing,” “Onboarding Flow,” “Personalization,” “Contextual Timing,” “Gamification,” etc.

Fill in each cell with at least one concrete test idea. This approach:

- Ensures coverage of multiple angles.
- Helps the team systematically review options.
- Encourages brainstorming aligned to specific user needs.

---

## Conclusion

Beyond basic format, text, design, context, and modality, a robust user acquisition strategy—especially in a large enterprise ecosystem—can also explore **Pricing & Incentives, Onboarding Flows, Personalization & Targeting, Trust & Social Proof, Timing & Frequency, Ecosystem Synergies, Gamification,** and **Analytics**. Each dimension offers unique levers to refine how (and when) you position **Pro** to prospective users. By systematically testing across these expanded dimensions, your team can unearth deeper insights, drive more organic conversions, and align Pro’s value proposition with user motivations at every touchpoint in the Indeed ecosystem.

excellent. i've thought about the problem space a bit more and have these notes on our first phase. review these notes and revise the ideas and organization accordingly
---
# Introduction
The team has two product workstreams: **Pro** and **Premium**.

- Pro (in US) has completed its Phase 1. We are now planning for Phase 2 of acquisition, in which job seekers will receive Pro in exchange for Crowtaxo questions. We are working on this in partnership with the Onboarding team.

- Premium (in Canada) is in Phase 1 of its acquisition strategy. The focus is on increasing free trial unlocks, leveraging U.S. data that shows Premium features lead to improved job-seeker outcomes.

This document outlines the problem statements, success metrics, and next steps for each phase.

---
## Premium Acquisition
### Phase 1
#### Problem Statement/s

1. Data from US experimentation shows that using Premium features (eg: Top Choice, Top Applicant) results in better outcomes for job seekers.
2. Job Seekers in Canada can access these same features for free for 7 days.
3. Job Seekers who do not take advantage of the free trial to unlock Premium features for 7 days of their job search are missing out on tools that measurably improve their outcome on Indeed for free.

#### Success Metrics & Drivers
**Free → Free Trial Conversion Rate**: This measures how effectively we help free job seekers start enjoying Premium’s benefits during their job search.*

**Metric Drivers**

1. ↑ Free Trial Unlock Opportunities

	- Goal: Increase the contexts where job seekers can unlock the Premium free trial.
	- Desired Outcome: Make Premium’s value more accessible and visible at relevant moments (e.g., SERP, profile view, mid-apply prompts).

2. ↑ Accounts with an impression

	- Goal: Increase the number of accounts that see or become aware of the Premium free trial.
	- Desired Outcome: Ensure broad exposure, so we can gather data across various segments and job-seeker behaviors.

3. ↑ Conversion Rate
	- Goal: Increase the number of Impressed accounts that sign up for a Free Trial
	- Desired Outcome: Job seekers see the right promotion in the right placement for the right product at the right time.

# Acquisition Strategy: Pro (US) & Premium (Canada)

## 1. Introduction

Indeed currently has two product workstreams aiming to enhance job seekers’ success:

1. **Pro (US)**
   - **Phase 1** is completed.
   - **Phase 2** is upcoming, in partnership with the Onboarding team, where job seekers receive Pro in exchange for completing Crowtaxo questions.

2. **Premium (Canada)**
   - **Phase 1** is underway.
   - Focus: Increase free trial unlocks. U.S. data indicates Premium features (e.g., Top Choice, Top Applicant) improve job seeker outcomes.

This document outlines the **problem statements**, **success metrics**, and **next steps** for Premium’s Phase 1 acquisition plan, with an eye toward applying similar principles to Pro’s Phase 2 efforts.

---

## 2. Premium Acquisition (Canada)

### 2.1 Phase 1 Goals

Canadian job seekers can access Premium features free for 7 days, yet many do not take advantage of this offer. We need to **increase awareness and utilization** of these trial features to improve user outcomes and ultimately drive conversions.

#### Problem Statements

1. **Proven Value**: U.S. testing shows Premium features (Top Choice, Top Applicant) measurably improve job seeker outcomes.
2. **Opportunity**: Canadian job seekers have a **7-day free trial** but may not realize the value or know how to unlock it.
3. **Missed Benefits**: Those who do not unlock the free trial are missing out on features that can significantly benefit their job search.

#### Success Metrics & Drivers

- **Key Metric**: **Free → Free Trial Conversion Rate**\
  Measures how effectively we drive job seekers to start (and experience) Premium benefits.

- **Primary Drivers**:
  1. **↑ Free Trial Unlock Opportunities**
     - Make Premium’s free trial entry points more visible at relevant moments (SERP, Profile View, mid-apply prompts).
  2. **↑ Accounts with an Impression**
     - Increase the number of accounts exposed to Premium’s free trial messaging at least once.
  3. **↑ Conversion Rate**
     - Among those who see a Premium offer, increase sign-up by surfacing the right promotion at the right place and time.

## 4. Next Steps for Premium, Phase 1

1. **Identify High-Impression Surfaces**
   - SERP and Profile are prime, but we should also consider mid-apply placements or MyJobs for **contextual** upsell opportunities.

2. **Align Messaging & Design**
   - Work with Content and Design teams to refine how we present the free trial.
   - Test **short, benefit-driven** copy (emotional triggers, data-driven claims, etc.).

3. **Launch Small-Scale Experiments**
   - Start with a few **A/B tests** around the highest-traffic surfaces.
   - Measure impact on Free → Free Trial conversions.

4. **Monitor, Refine, & Scale**
   - Use analytics to attribute conversions to specific experiments.
   - Scale winning variations quickly; iterate or retire unsuccessful ones.

---

## 5. Pro Acquisition (US) – Preview for Phase 2

Though not the current focus, lessons from Premium Phase 1 can inform the **next phase** for Pro in the U.S. Specifically:

- **Onboarding Integration**: Partner with the Onboarding team to ensure **Crowtaxo** questions align with the user’s job search flow.
- **Seamless Feature Introduction**: Borrow “locked/blurred” or mid-apply teaser tactics to highlight Pro’s unique value.
- **Data-Driven Expansion**: Track how well crowtaxo-based sign-ups convert into paying users, then refine messaging.

---

## 6. Conclusion

- **Premium Phase 1** aims to increase the Free → Free Trial conversion rate in Canada, leveraging proven feature value from the U.S.
- A structured **experimentation approach** across the 10 dimensions (Format, Text, Design, Context, Modality, etc.) will help unlock more trial sign-ups and ensure job seekers experience the genuine benefits of Premium.
- **Future phases** for both Premium (Canada) and Pro (US) can build on learnings from these early experiments, creating a cohesive, data-driven strategy that scales globally.

By iterating on **where** and **how** we introduce the free trial, we can maximize exposure and conversion while maintaining a **user-centric** experience—ultimately reinforcing Indeed’s core mission: helping people get jobs.

i think the experimentation table is comflating many concepts.
- improvements to the product - these don't directly improve free trial conversion rates bc the job seeker has already signed up by the time they are using the feature.
- experiments with pricing - pricing has only an indirecet impact on free trial signsups since job seekers can cancel anytime for free
- separating the concepts like placement, format, etc. from copy changes, product improvements etc. these are all related in a way. for example we will have a hypothesis that trying to acquire users in X high traffic workflow at indeed will be good. we will develop a feature that is relevant to those job seekers so we can expand the addressable market of premium by keeping the relevancy of the offering high in these new audience
- remember these  are the metrics we are trying to drive right now; nothing else

Drivers of Success Metric:
↑ Free Trial Unlock Opportunities
Make Premium’s free trial entry points more visible at relevant moments (SERP, Profile View, mid-apply prompts).
↑ Accounts with an Impression
Increase the number of accounts exposed to Premium’s free trial messaging at least once.
↑ Conversion Rate
Among those who see a Premium offer, increase sign-up by surfacing the right promotion at the right place at the right time.

Below is a **re-focused framework** that zeroes in **exclusively** on **acquisition**—i.e., driving **free trial unlocks** for Premium. This framework separates high-level levers (e.g., **Placement**, **Format**, **Copy**, **Context**), ensuring we’re not conflating longer-term product improvements or pricing experiments with the **immediate goal**: increasing awareness (Impressions) and driving more trial sign-ups (Conversion Rate).

---

## Why This Refined Approach?

1. **Immediate Focus**: We only care about **free trial conversions** right now. Enhancements that users experience **after** they’ve already unlocked the free trial (e.g., upgraded features, advanced dashboards) or changes to paid pricing structures **won’t** directly affect trial sign-ups in the near term.
2. **Clarity**: By isolating these acquisition levers, it’s easier to design experiments and measure their direct impact on the **key success metrics**:
   - **$\uparrow$** Free Trial Unlock Opportunities
   - **$\uparrow$** Accounts with an Impression
   - **$\uparrow$** Conversion Rate among Impressed Accounts

### Notes on Exclusions

- **Product Improvements** (e.g., advanced analytics or post-trial features) don’t directly influence free trial sign-up. They can help with retention or paid conversion **after** the trial, but they’re not the priority for immediate acquisition.
- **Pricing Changes** (e.g., monthly cost, discounts) have minimal direct effect on a **free** trial sign-up, since users can cancel before paying.
- **Post-Trial Engagement** (e.g., usage analytics) is useful for retention, not for initial free trial unlock.

## Connecting to the Core Drivers

We can map each **lever** to one (or multiple) of the three **key drivers**:

1. **Increase Free Trial Unlock Opportunities**
   - More *Placement* surfaces, *Contextual triggers*, or new *Audiences* = more potential sign-up entry points.

2. **Increase Accounts with an Impression**
   - Show the free trial messaging more frequently or in more relevant places (*Format* changes, *Timing* triggers).

3. **Increase Conversion Rate**
   - More compelling *Copy*, more targeted *Audience*, and better *Placement* at the precise *Context* push more “Impressed” users to sign up.

By systematically testing each lever **individually** (A/B tests) or in **combination** (multivariate tests), we isolate what most effectively drives the free trial conversion metric.

---

## Example Experiment Flow

1. **Hypothesis**: Adding a mid-apply inline card with relevant copy (“Know your ranking before you finish applying!”) will increase free trial sign-ups by 10%.
2. **Execution**:
   - **Placement**: Mid-apply flow
   - **Format**: Inline card vs. banner
   - **Copy**: Benefit-oriented messaging
3. **Measurement**: Track
   - **Impressions**: % of mid-apply visitors who see the upsell
   - **CTR**: % who click on the upsell
   - **Sign-Up Rate**: % of those who click that actually start the free trial
4. **Analysis & Next Steps**:
   - If sign-ups outperform baseline, consider expanding that approach to other surfaces (SERP, MyJobs).
   - If sign-ups do not improve, iterate on copy/format or try a different surface.

---

## Conclusion

This simplified view keeps the team laser-focused on **near-term acquisition**—increasing **free trial unlocks** by refining:

- **Where** (Placement) and **How** (Format) we surface the trial.
- **What** we say (Copy), **When** we say it (Context), and **Who** sees it (Audience).
- **Addressable Market** expansions only if they tangibly increase the pool of potential free trial users.

By aligning each experiment to one of the **three critical drivers** (Unlock Opportunities, Impressions, and Conversion Rate), we ensure we’re not conflating broader product or pricing experiments with the immediate goal: **getting more job seekers to try Premium** and experience its value.

### How to Use These Hypotheses

1. **Brainstorm**: Use each hypothesis as a **springboard** to generate additional experiments or variations.
2. **Test & Learn**: For each idea, run an A/B test to confirm or refute the hypothesis.
3. **Refine**: Gather quantitative data (conversion lifts, click-through rates) and qualitative feedback (surveys, user interviews) to refine or discard hypotheses.
4. **Iterate**: Successful hypotheses can be **scaled** to new surfaces or expanded to other user segments; unsuccessful ones often inspire new approaches.

By capturing the **first-principles reasoning** behind each experiment, you create a transparent, repeatable **thought process**—empowering the team to not only design better tests now but also adapt and evolve quickly as **new data** emerges.

### How These First Principles Elevate Experimentation

1. **Idea Generation**: By articulating why we expect a tactic to work, it’s easier to conceive additional variations or brand-new experiments that lean on the same principle (e.g., “Visibility Principle” prompts exploring new surfaces).
2. **Hypothesis Validation**: When a test fails or succeeds, referencing these core assumptions helps us learn whether the principle itself was off-base or if execution (copy, design) might need tweaking.
3. **Scalability**: The same first principle—e.g., “Contextual Relevance”—can **guide** expansions to other surfaces (profile pages, job alerts) without reinventing the core logic each time.
4. **Team Alignment**: Sharing these principles clarifies for **all stakeholders** (Design, Engineering, Content) why we prioritize certain surfaces or approaches, ensuring a more cohesive product strategy.

By structuring each experiment around its **hypothesis** and **the underlying logic**, your team can systematically test, learn, and refine—without conflating acquisition-focused efforts with broader product or pricing changes. This approach keeps the team laser-focused on the **core drivers** of free-trial sign-ups:

- **$\uparrow$** Free Trial Unlock Opportunities
- **$\uparrow$** Accounts with an Impression
- **$\uparrow$** Conversion Rate among Impressed Accounts

and ensures each experiment is grounded in clear, evidence-based reasoning that can evolve as new data comes in.

Below is a **critical review** of the current experimentation table, along with **specific recommendations** for improving clarity, alignment, and utility. These suggested changes aim to maintain the table’s focus on **immediate free-trial acquisition** while making the underlying logic and hypotheses more transparent and actionable.

---

## 1. Potential Overlap or Redundancy

1. **“Placement” vs. “Context/Timing”**
   - *Overlap Issue*: Both columns discuss *where* and *when* an upsell appears (e.g., mid-apply flow, after 3 job apps).
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Keep “Placement” strictly about **which surfaces** we use (SERP, MyJobs, Profile, etc.).
     - Keep “Context/Timing” strictly about **user-triggered events** (applying to a certain number of jobs, revisiting profile).
     - If there’s a scenario that involves both (e.g., a mid-apply upsell), clarify it under each column but from **different angles**.

2. **“Addressable Market” vs. “Audience/Relevancy”**
   - *Overlap Issue*: Both discuss expanding or targeting user segments.
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Use “Audience/Relevancy” to describe **segment-specific** messaging for existing audiences (frequent applicants, career switchers).
     - Use “Addressable Market” for **creating or exposing new audiences** (e.g., new micro-features to attract remote seekers, cross-workflow promotions).

---

## 2. Column Structure & Ordering

Currently, the table has these columns:

1. Lever
2. Focus
3. Experiment Examples
4. Hypothesis
5. First Principles
6. Key Metrics Impacted

**Opportunities for Improvement**:

- **Combine or Rename “Focus” and “Experiment Examples”**: The “Focus” column is partially restated in the “Experiment Examples.” You could unify them as **“Focus & Sample Experiments”** to reduce redundancy.
- **Reorder Columns**: Sometimes it’s more natural to flow from **Hypothesis → First Principles → Experiment Examples**, so that the table reads like “What we believe (Hypothesis), why (Principles), how we plan to test it (Examples).”

### Possible Revised Column Order

1. **Lever**
2. **Hypothesis**
3. **First Principles (Underlying Logic)**
4. **Sample Experiments**
5. **Key Metrics Impacted**

This sequence walks the reader logically from **the belief (Hypothesis)** to **why it matters (Principles)** to **how we act on it (Experiment)** to **what we measure (Metrics)**.

---

## 3. Consistency & Clarity in Each Row

1. **Standardize the Format of Hypotheses**
   - Some rows have numbered points (e.g., “1. SERP Hypothesis”) while others don’t. Use a consistent style—either bullet each sub-hypothesis or keep it inline.
   - Example:
     - **Placement Hypothesis 1**: If we surface Premium on SERP, more users will see it...
     - **Placement Hypothesis 2**: Mid-apply prompts are contextually relevant...

2. **Ensure Each Hypothesis Clearly Ties to a Single Underlying Principle**
   - Some entries list multiple **first principles** (e.g., “Visibility Principle,” “Contextual Relevance Principle”). That’s great for thoroughness, but consider highlighting **which** principle is the core driver for each sub-hypothesis.

3. **Link Each Experiment Example Directly Back to the Stated Hypothesis**
   - If you say, “An inline card on SERP should reduce ad blindness,” make sure that line explicitly refers back to **Ad Blindness** or **Visibility** in the first principles. This keeps the logic chain tight and easy to follow.

---

## 4. Scope & Focus on Near-Term Acquisition

1. **Remove or Subordinate Non-Acquisition References**
   - The table should stay laser-focused on **free trial unlocks**. If you’ve mentioned anything about post-trial experiences, advanced analytics, or long-term pricing, move it to a separate document or footnote.
2. **Consider Adding a “Potential Pitfalls / Constraints” Column** *(Optional)*
   - While not mandatory, some teams like to quickly note potential **risks** (e.g., user annoyance with pop-ups, implementation complexity on certain surfaces) to help prioritize experiments.

---

## 5. Strengthen or Add First Principles Where Gaps Appear

1. **Behavioral Psychology**: Some rows might reference a user’s mental or emotional states. For instance, if you talk about *FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)* or *Cognitive Overload*, consider explicitly stating that principle in the “First Principles” column.
2. **Social Proof / Trust**: If you plan to test endorsements or star ratings, articulate that principle: “Seeing other users’ success fosters trust and reduces perceived risk.”
3. **Data & Iteration**: If your experiments rely on user-level or usage data to trigger an upsell, you might highlight a “Data-Driven Personalization Principle” in the first principles.

---

## Summary of Key Recommendations

1. **Clarify Overlapping Columns**
   - Distinguish “Placement” (surface-based) from “Context/Timing” (event-based).
   - Distinguish “Audience/Relevancy” (segment-specific) from “Addressable Market” (new user segments or surfaces).

2. **Refine Table Structure**
   - Potentially merge **Focus** + **Experiment Examples** into one column.
   - Order columns to lead from **Hypothesis** → **Principles** → **Experiments** → **Metrics**.

3. **Standardize Content**
   - Number or bullet each hypothesis consistently.
   - Ensure each experiment references the specific principle(s) it leverages.

4. **Optional Additions**
   - “Pitfalls/Constraints” column for each row, addressing feasibility or user experience risks.
   - More explicit references to underlying **behavioral psychology** or **trust** principles if relevant.

5. **Maintain Immediate Acquisition Focus**
   - Exclude or minimize mention of post-trial experiences, advanced product improvements, or pricing changes that do not impact free trial sign-ups directly.

By **applying these refinements**, your table will be more cohesive, easier for stakeholders to consume, and more conducive to **iterative ideation**. Most importantly, it will preserve a **clear line of sight** from fundamental beliefs (first principles) to testable hypotheses to experiment execution, all tightly tied to **increasing free-trial unlocks** in the near term.

## Additional Notes / Recommendations

1. **Distinguish Placement vs. Context**
   - **Placement** = *which surfaces* (SERP, Profile, MyJobs).
   - **Context** = *which events or triggers* (after 3 job apps, returning to profile, etc.).
   - This avoids overlap and keeps experiments focused.

2. **Maintain Near-Term Acquisition Focus**
   - Table entries address only **free trial unlocks**; advanced features or pricing changes can be documented elsewhere.

3. **Leverage First Principles to Brainstorm Variations**
   - Each principle (e.g., *Visibility Principle*) can inspire new placements or formats.
   - If a test fails, revisit the principle: Was the timing off, or is the principle less valid for that segment?

4. **Possible Future Addition**
   - A “**Constraints or Pitfalls**” column, if needed, to capture user annoyance risks, dev complexity, etc.

By consolidating the **Hypothesis → First Principles → Experiment Examples → Key Metrics** flow, this table remains concise yet transparent, ensuring every acquisition test directly ties to a **core logical belief** and a **specific KPI** (free trial unlocks, impressions, conversion rate).

Below are a few **additional suggestions** and **clarifications** that can enrich your matrix, ensuring it remains a **practical** and **actionable** resource for your team:

---

### 1. Consider Adding a “Measurement & Testing” Note

- **Why**: To make it explicit **how** you’ll evaluate success for each lever (Placement, Format, etc.).
- **What to Include**:
  - **Metrics**: Reference specific metrics beyond conversion rate (e.g., Click-Through Rate (CTR), sign-up funnel drop-off).
  - **Testing Approach**: Note if you plan to use **A/B testing**, **multivariate** tests, or **phased rollouts** (e.g., 10% of users see the new feature).
  - **Analysis**: Briefly call out **attribution** (how to confirm which experiment triggered the conversion).

A simple one-liner per row can suffice, such as: “Will run an A/B test measuring CTR on inline card vs. banner and subsequent free trial sign-up rate.”

---

### 2. Acknowledge Potential Constraints or Pitfalls

- **Why**: Each lever may have **technical**, **design**, or **user experience** constraints.
- **What to Include**:
  - **Dev Complexity**: Some surfaces might be harder to implement a feature on (e.g., SERP might require more backend complexity).
  - **UX Balance**: Intrusive designs could annoy job seekers or cause brand perception issues.
  - **Experiment Interference**: Overlapping tests in multiple places at once can confound results.

If you prefer to keep the matrix lean, you can add a separate footnote or a small “Risks” section.

---

### 3. Clarify Timing vs. Placement

- **Why**: “Placement” (SERP, MyJobs, etc.) and “Context” (after 3 applications, returning to profile) can blend together.
- **How**:
  - In the **Placement** row, emphasize “*static page location*” (SERP, MyJobs, Profile).
  - In the **Context** row, emphasize “*dynamic triggers*” (user hits certain behaviors, events, or thresholds).
  - This distinction helps you avoid accidental overlap.

---

### 4. Highlight Cross-Lever Synergies

- **Why**: The biggest gains often come from **combining** these levers—e.g., the right copy **plus** the right placement **plus** a timely context trigger.
- **Example**:
  - “Display an **inline card** (Format) on the **SERP** (Placement), triggered **after the user searches 3 times** (Context), featuring **benefit-oriented copy** (Copy).”
  - Noting that synergy can help your team see how to orchestrate experiments across dimensions.

---

### 5. Emphasize Iteration and Learning

- **Why**: The matrix should remind teams this is an **iterative** process, where each experiment’s result feeds the next hypothesis.
- **How**:
  - In a concluding note, reiterate: “Each lever’s outcome informs subsequent changes to Copy or Placement. If an experiment fails, revisit its First Principles to refine or pivot.”

---

### 6. Keep the Focus on Near-Term Acquisition Only

- **Why**: It’s easy to drift into long-term retention or product improvements.
- **How**:
  - Reiterate in a short, pinned note: “**Goal**: Drive free trial sign-ups. Paid conversion or feature satisfaction is out of scope for this matrix.”
  - If new ideas come up regarding post-trial experience, record them separately to maintain clarity.

---

## Final Thoughts

By adding a **measurement/testing** layer, acknowledging potential **constraints**, clarifying the **distinction** between timing and placement, and noting **synergies** across levers, you’ll create a **robust, practical** matrix. This ensures your team can **quickly reference** each lever, see what success looks like, and effectively prioritize experiments that **maximize free trial unlocks**.

excellent. let's refine the hypothese now. the hypotheses we need are in the form of [who] + [what changed] + [what is expected impact] + [why that expected impact] . for example: job seekers who are offered a 14 day free trial instead of a 7 day free trial  free trial will be more likely to sign up for a free trial because the longer free trial gives them more time to experience the benefits of the feature.
the reason this is helpful is because if we do think that time to experience benefit is the mechanism of impact, we can also affect this hypothesis by decreasing time to value

review the existing hypotheses below and propose new hypotheses that address all parts of this formula. think deeply.
```
Lever	Underlying Principles	Potential Experiment Examples	Measurement & Testing	Potential Pitfalls/Constraints	Synergies with Other Levers
Placement
Where free trial offers are shown*	- People can’t sign up for what they never see.
- The closer the upsell is to a natural action (e.g., applying), the more organic it feels.
- Surfacing the offer on pages the job seeker already visits decreases the steps needed to act on the promotion.	1. SERP Banner/Card: Insert an inline card or banner in top search results after the 2nd/3rd listing.
2. MyJobs: A targeted prompt on the user’s saved or applied-jobs list.
3. Profile Page: A subtle callout for “Who Viewed My Profile,” offering a free trial for deeper insights.	- A/B test different placements (SERP vs. Profile vs. MyJobs) and track Impressions, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Free Trial Sign-Ups.
- Use page-specific analytics to see which surface yields the highest conversion.	- Technical Complexity: Some surfaces (e.g., SERP) may be harder to implement changes on.
- Risk of Clutter: Too many ads across surfaces can overwhelm or annoy users.
- Experiment Overlap: Running multiple placements at once could confound attribution.	- Context: Combine SERP placement with event triggers (e.g., after 3 job searches).
- Copy: Tailor the text to the user’s location (Profile vs. SERP).
Format
The type of promo (banner, inline card, pop-up, etc.)	- Subtle, well-placed elements can outperform large banners if timed correctly.
- Overly intrusive pop-ups can annoy job seekers, but a targeted pop-up at a decisive moment can nudge them effectively.	1. Inline Card vs. Banner: Embed a card in the page content vs. a persistent floating banner.
2. Bottom-Sheet Pop-up: Trigger it when the user scrolls 50% down or after an action, like clicking “Apply.”	- Multivariate testing on format type vs. location: measure CTR and Time on Page to ensure minimal disruption.
- User surveys or quick feedback prompts to assess annoyance levels.	- User Experience Risk: Banners may be ignored if they resemble ads; pop-ups could frustrate users if poorly timed.
- Technical Implementation: A bottom-sheet pop-up might require additional front-end dev resources.	- Copy: Pair appropriate messaging style with each format (pop-up might require shorter text).
- Context: Pop-ups can be event-triggered for higher relevance.
Copy
What the promo says (CTA text, tone, benefits)	- Job seekers must quickly understand why Premium is beneficial.
- Urgent or aspirational phrasing can create immediacy, while neutral statements can build trust.	1. Benefit-Oriented CTA: “See if you’re a Top Applicant—unlock Premium now!”
2. Aspirational vs. Neutral: Test “Don’t miss out on your free trial!” vs. “Try Premium free for 7 days.”
3. Data-Driven: Show “75% of Premium users land interviews faster—start your free trial.” (if data supports it)	- Run A/B text tests with different headlines, measure CTR and subsequent Sign-Up Rate.
- Use segment-level measurement to see if certain phrasing resonates with specific groups (e.g., frequent applicants).	- Brand Tone Consistency: Overly pushy or sensational copy might harm trust.
- Data Accuracy: If using stats (“75% of Premium users…”), ensure they’re accurate and regularly updated.	- Format: Shorter, punchier text might perform better in pop-ups; longer copy could work in inline cards.
- Relevance: Mention relevant features based on user’s situation (frequent applicant, career switcher).
Context
When and in what context the offer appears	- The more an upsell aligns with a job seeker’s current need, the higher the chance of conversion.
- Job seekers often decide impulsively at friction points; timely offers can capture that intent.	1. Event-Triggered: After a user applies to 3+ jobs in one session, show “Unlock Premium to track your ranking.”
2. Behavior-Based: If a user revisits profile insights multiple times, prompt them about deeper analytics available in Premium.
3. Time-of-Day: If data shows peak usage at certain hours, schedule pop-ups accordingly.	- Targeted A/B tests: Compare sign-up rates between users who receive event-triggered prompts vs. those who see static offers.
- Funnel analysis: Check if users triggered by context-based events have higher subsequent engagement with Premium.	- Over-personalization Risk: Might feel creepy or invasive if too granular (e.g., “We noticed you do X…”).
- Implementation Complexity: Requires real-time or near-real-time event tracking.	- Placement: Use mid-apply flow or SERP triggers.
- Format: Could combine event triggers with a minimal pop-up for immediate impact.
Relevance
Who sees the promo, and how it’s personalized	- Job seekers who recognize a specific friction (many apps, changing industries) see Premium’s upsell as genuinely helpful.
- Tailored messaging increases perceived value and reduces resistance.	1. Frequent Applicants: If a user applies to 5+ jobs quickly, highlight Premium’s organizational or ranking benefits.
2. Career Switchers: “Explore new industries faster—unlock Premium free.”
3. Location/Industry Specific: “Looking for remote roles? Premium can help filter top remote-friendly employers.”	- Use segmented funnels to track sign-up rate among frequent applicants vs. occasional applicants, etc.
- Possibly run personalized experiment variants and measure each segment’s conversion lift.	- Data Availability: Need consistent signals (e.g., how many jobs a user applied for, whether they’re switching industries).
- Privacy Concerns: Over-personalization might raise user trust issues if they feel tracked.	- Copy: Match the pitch to the user’s known friction.
- Context: Trigger personalized offers at relevant times (e.g., after repeated job applications).
Expansion
Expanding the pool of relevant potential job seekers	- The larger the relevant addressable audience, the more potential sign-ups overall.
- If a new feature directly addresses a segment’s need, they see immediate utility.	1. New Micro-Feature: Highlight a “remote job filter” or other specialized feature as a “Premium perk” for a newly identified segment (e.g., remote job hunters).
2. Cross-Workflow Promotions: Insert short callouts in advanced job searches or specialized filters to expose new segments to Premium.	- A/B test presence/absence of micro-feature promotions on usage and sign-up.
- Track segment growth (e.g., how many new users are engaging with remote job filters?), then measure how many convert to the free trial.	- Resource Allocation: Building or surfacing new features can be time-intensive.
- Feature Adoption Risk: If the micro-feature isn’t compelling or is poorly integrated, it may not expand the user base as intended.	- Placement: If you introduce a new remote job filter, place upsells within that flow.
- Relevance: Highlight the new feature specifically for the segment (remote job seekers, advanced search users).

Below is a **refined set of hypotheses** for each lever, following the requested **\[who] + \[what changed] + \[expected impact] + \[why that expected impact]** format. Each hypothesis is tightly focused on **free-trial sign-ups** and clarifies the underlying mechanism by which we expect the change to drive results.

---

## 1. Placement

**Where** free trial offers are shown

1. **SERP Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers actively searching for roles on the SERP.
   - **What changed**: Present a free trial offer after the 2nd or 3rd job listing.
   - **Expected Impact**: Increased free trial sign-ups.
   - **Why**: Because these users are already in “discovery mode,” a well-placed upsell in a high-traffic area reduces friction and piques immediate curiosity about Premium’s value.

2. **MyJobs Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers revisiting or managing saved/applied roles in MyJobs.
   - **What changed**: Display a free trial prompt whenever they view their saved/applied list.
   - **Expected Impact**: Increased free trial sign-ups.
   - **Why**: Because these users are evaluating their application progress, highlighting Premium’s tracking or ranking features in that moment feels naturally relevant and prompts them to try Premium.

---

## 2. Format

**The type** of promo (banner, inline card, pop-up, etc.)

1. **Inline Card Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers browsing job listings or profile pages.
   - **What changed**: Introduce an inline Premium upsell card embedded within the page content.
   - **Expected Impact**: Higher free trial sign-up rate.
   - **Why**: Because an in-flow card feels more integrated than a generic banner, reducing ad-blindness and encouraging users to engage with the offer as part of the natural page layout.

2. **Bottom-Sheet Pop-up Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers who scroll or take a specific action (e.g., click “Apply”).
   - **What changed**: Trigger a bottom-sheet pop-up at a decisive moment (e.g., 50% scroll).
   - **Expected Impact**: Improved free trial sign-up rate.
   - **Why**: Because capturing attention exactly when interest is high can gently nudge them to explore Premium’s benefits without interrupting core actions, striking a balance between visibility and user experience.

---

## 3. Copy

**What** the promo says (CTA text, tone, benefits)

1. **Benefit-Oriented Copy Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers reading about Premium features (e.g., “Top Applicant”).
   - **What changed**: Emphasize a single, concrete benefit in the CTA (“See if you’re a Top Applicant—unlock Premium now!”).
   - **Expected Impact**: Increased conversion to the free trial.
   - **Why**: Because highlighting a direct, job-search-related benefit helps job seekers quickly grasp “what’s in it for me,” motivating them to sign up.

2. **Aspirational vs. Neutral Copy Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Two groups of job seekers: one seeing “Don’t miss out on your free trial!” (aspirational/urgent) vs. another seeing “Try Premium free for 7 days.” (neutral).
   - **What changed**: Different emotional tones in the promo text.
   - **Expected Impact**: Variation in free trial sign-up rates (likely higher in aspirational group).
   - **Why**: Because urgent or emotional language can instill a sense of immediacy, while neutral text appeals to those who prefer trust and clarity—thus testing which segment responds best.

---

## 4. Context

**When** and **in what context** the offer appears

1. **Event-Triggered Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers who apply to 3 or more jobs in one session.
   - **What changed**: Show a free trial upsell (e.g., “Track your rank with Premium!”) immediately after their third application.
   - **Expected Impact**: Higher sign-up rate among these high-intent users.
   - **Why**: Because demonstrating consistent application behavior signals strong job-search motivation; providing a relevant upsell right then addresses their immediate needs.

2. **Behavior-Based Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers who repeatedly visit their profile insights page.
   - **What changed**: Display a free trial offer referencing deeper analytics or “Who viewed my profile?” after multiple visits.
   - **Expected Impact**: Greater free trial sign-ups from these data-focused users.
   - **Why**: Because repeated visits suggest a desire for more information, so emphasizing Premium’s extended insights aligns perfectly with their curiosity.

---

## 5. Relevance

**Who** sees the promo, and **how** it’s personalized

1. **Frequent Applicants Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Users who have applied to 5+ jobs within a short timeframe.
   - **What changed**: Tailor messaging to highlight how Premium can help them manage or rank multiple applications.
   - **Expected Impact**: Increased free trial sign-ups.
   - **Why**: Because addressing a specific friction (organizing multiple applications) makes Premium feel like a targeted solution rather than a generic upsell.

2. **Career Switchers Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Users who are exploring a new role/industry based on their search or resume data.
   - **What changed**: Show a customized upsell: “Discover new industries with advanced Premium insights—start your free trial.”
   - **Expected Impact**: Higher free trial sign-ups from career switchers.
   - **Why**: Because personalizing the offer around a user’s job-search pivot underscores Premium’s relevance and boosts the perceived value of upgrading.

---

## 6. Expansion

**Expanding** the pool of relevant potential job seekers

1. **New Micro-Feature Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers interested in specialized or remote roles.
   - **What changed**: Introduce or highlight a new micro-feature (e.g., remote job filter) as a “Premium perk.”
   - **Expected Impact**: Increased free trial sign-ups among that niche.
   - **Why**: Because offering a feature specifically tailored to their unique needs expands Premium’s addressable audience and provides immediate utility.

2. **Cross-Workflow Promotion Hypothesis**
   - **Who**: Job seekers using advanced search or specialized filters who rarely see the main Premium surfaces.
   - **What changed**: Insert short Premium callouts within those lesser-used workflows.
   - **Expected Impact**: More free trial sign-ups from untapped segments.

### Final Note on “Mechanism of Impact”

All these hypotheses explicitly link **who** we’re targeting, **what** is changing, **how** that’s expected to affect behavior, and **why** that outcome is logical. This structure helps your team:

- Evaluate whether the **mechanism** (e.g., “time to experience benefit,” “immediate context,” “pain-point alignment”) is truly driving the outcome.
- Brainstorm complementary ways to achieve the same effect (e.g., if “time to experience benefit” matters, you could extend the free trial **or** expedite “aha” moments within 7 days).

By consistently applying this hypothesis format, you’ll be better equipped to test, learn, and refine your free trial acquisition strategy in a **data-driven**, **user-focused** manner.

- Surfacing the offer on pages the job seeker already visits decreases the steps needed to act on the promotion."	"SERP Promo

    Who: Job seekers actively searching for roles on the SERP.
    What changed: Present a free trial offer after the 2nd or 3rd job listing.
    Expected Impact: Increased free trial sign-ups.
    Why: Because these users are already in “discovery mode,” a well-placed upsell in a high-traffic area reduces friction and piques immediate curiosity about Premium’s value.

MyJobs Promo 

    Who: Job seekers revisiting or managing saved/applied roles in MyJobs.
    What changed: Display a free trial prompt whenever they view their saved/applied list.
    Expected Impact: Increased free trial sign-ups.

"Format 
The type of promo (banner, inline card, pop-up, etc.)"	"- Subtle, well-placed elements can outperform large banners if timed correctly.
- Overly intrusive pop-ups can annoy job seekers, but a targeted pop-up at a decisive moment can nudge them effectively."	"Inline Card

    Who: Job seekers browsing job listings or profile pages.
    What changed: Introduce an inline Premium upsell card embedded within the page content.
    Expected Impact: Higher free trial sign-up rate.

Bottom-Sheet Pop-up

    Who: Job seekers who scroll or take a specific action (e.g., click “Apply”).
    What changed: Trigger a bottom-sheet pop-up at a decisive moment (e.g., 50% scroll).
    Expected Impact: Improved free trial sign-up rate.
    Why: Because capturing attention exactly when interest is high can gently nudge them to explore Premium’s benefits without interrupting core actions, striking a balance between visibility and user experience."

What the promo says (CTA text, tone, benefits)"	"- Job seekers must quickly understand why Premium is beneficial.
- Urgent or aspirational phrasing can create immediacy, while neutral statements can build trust."	"Benefit-Oriented Copy

Below is an **updated version** of your matrix with minor **refinements** to ensure each hypothesis follows the **\[who] + \[what changed] + \[expected impact] + \[why that expected impact]** format consistently. We’ve also slightly adjusted the “Cross Promotion” item under **Expansion** to clarify the reasoning behind targeting that specific audience. Everything else remains the same unless noted.
