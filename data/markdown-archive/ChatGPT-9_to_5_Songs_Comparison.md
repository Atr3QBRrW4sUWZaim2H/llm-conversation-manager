Sheena Easton’s “9 to 5” and Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” are two completely different songs that just happen to share (nearly) the same title. They were released around the same time (1980 for Easton’s UK single and 1980/81 for Parton’s single from the film *9 to 5*), and confusion arose—especially in the U.S.—because of their similar names.

- **Sheena Easton’s “9 to 5”** was her second single in the UK, and it’s actually about waiting for her partner to come home from his 9–5 job.
  - In the U.S., to avoid confusion with Dolly Parton’s song, it was retitled **“Morning Train (Nine to Five)”**.
  - It became one of Easton’s biggest hits, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1981.

- **Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5”** was written as the theme song for the 1980 film *9 to 5*, in which Parton co-starred with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.
  - The track was also a big success, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming a signature song for Dolly Parton.

In short, aside from sharing a title and release proximity, they are unrelated: different lyrics, different melodies, and different contexts. The U.S. title change to “Morning Train (Nine to Five)” for Sheena Easton’s release was simply to avoid confusion with Dolly Parton’s chart-topping single.
